# Headless Agent Orchestration in Claude Code

## Overview

This guide explains how to implement headless agent orchestration in Claude Code, enabling parallel processing across multiple specialized agents. This pattern is based on event-driven multi-agent systems and allows you to spawn, manage, and coordinate multiple agents simultaneously.

## Core Concept

Headless agent orchestration allows you to:
- **Spawn multiple agents** to work in parallel on different aspects of a task
- **Coordinate agent activities** without direct dependencies between them
- **Aggregate results** from multiple agents into comprehensive outputs
- **Scale processing** by adding more agents as needed

## Architecture Pattern

### Event-Driven Multi-Agent System
```
Master Orchestrator
    ↓
Spawn Multiple Agents (Parallel)
    ↓
Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → ... → Agent N
    ↓         ↓         ↓              ↓
Results → Results → Results → ... → Results
    ↓
Aggregation & Synthesis
    ↓
Final Output
```

### Key Components

1. **Master Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates the entire process
2. **Specialized Worker Agents**: Perform specific tasks in parallel
3. **Result Aggregation**: Combines outputs from all agents
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures consistency across all agents

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create the Master Orchestrator Agent

Create a new agent file: `.claude/agents/master-orchestrator.md`

```yaml
---
name: master-orchestrator
description: Orchestrates multiple headless agents for parallel processing
tools: Task, Bash, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookEdit, Grep, LS, Read, WebSearch
color: purple
---
```

### Step 2: Define Agent Spawning Patterns

#### Research Parallelization
```bash
# Spawn multiple research agents for different entities
Task(
  description="Research company A",
  prompt="Conduct comprehensive research on [Company A] including financials, leadership, recent news, and market position",
  subagent_type="online-researcher"
)

Task(
  description="Research company B", 
  prompt="Conduct comprehensive research on [Company B] including financials, leadership, recent news, and market position",
  subagent_type="online-researcher"
)
```

#### Content Creation Parallelization
```bash
# Spawn platform-specific content agents
Task(
  description="Create LinkedIn content",
  prompt="Create professional LinkedIn post about [topic] with industry insights and engagement hooks",
  subagent_type="content-creator"
)

Task(
  description="Create X thread",
  prompt="Create viral X thread about [topic] with storytelling and engagement elements",
  subagent_type="thread-crafter"
)
```

### Step 3: Implement Result Aggregation

```bash
# Spawn aggregation agent to compile results
Task(
  description="Compile research results",
  prompt="Aggregate and synthesize research results from all agents into a comprehensive report with comparative analysis and recommendations",
  subagent_type="analytical-writer"
)
```

## Use Case Examples

### Example 1: Company Research Orchestration

**Scenario**: Research 10 tech companies for investment analysis

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Spawn 10 research agents in parallel
companies = ["OpenAI", "Anthropic", "Google", "Microsoft", "Meta", "Apple", "Amazon", "Netflix", "Tesla", "NVIDIA"]

for company in companies:
  Task(
    description=f"Research {company}",
    prompt=f"Conduct comprehensive research on {company} including: 1) Company overview and history 2) Financial performance and metrics 3) Leadership team and structure 4) Recent news and developments 5) Market position and competitors 6) Growth prospects and risks",
    subagent_type="online-researcher"
  )

# Spawn aggregation agent
Task(
  description="Compile investment analysis",
  prompt="Aggregate research results from all 10 companies into a comprehensive investment analysis report with comparative analysis, risk assessment, and investment recommendations",
  subagent_type="analytical-writer"
)
```

### Example 2: Multi-Platform Content Creation

**Scenario**: Create content for 5 different social media platforms

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Spawn platform-specific content agents
platforms = ["LinkedIn", "X", "Instagram", "YouTube", "Substack"]

for platform in platforms:
  Task(
    description=f"Create {platform} content",
    prompt=f"Create engaging content about [topic] optimized for {platform} including platform-specific best practices, audience targeting, and engagement strategies",
    subagent_type="content-creator"
  )

# Spawn coordination agent
Task(
  description="Cross-platform content strategy",
  prompt="Analyze all platform-specific content and create a unified cross-platform content strategy with consistent messaging and optimal posting schedule",
  subagent_type="content-strategist"
)
```

### Example 3: Parallel Analysis Tasks

**Scenario**: Analyze a company from multiple perspectives

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Spawn specialized analysis agents
Task(
  description="Financial analysis",
  prompt="Analyze financial metrics and ratios for [company] including revenue growth, profitability, debt levels, and cash flow",
  subagent_type="analytical-writer"
)

Task(
  description="Market analysis", 
  prompt="Analyze market trends and competitive landscape for [company] including market share, competitive advantages, and industry dynamics",
  subagent_type="research-analyst"
)

Task(
  description="Technical analysis",
  prompt="Analyze technical aspects and innovation potential for [company] including R&D investments, patent portfolio, and technological capabilities",
  subagent_type="base"
)

# Spawn synthesis agent
Task(
  description="Comprehensive analysis synthesis",
  prompt="Combine financial, market, and technical analysis into a comprehensive company assessment with strategic insights and recommendations",
  subagent_type="analytical-writer"
)
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection
- **Research Tasks**: Use `online-researcher` or `research-analyst` agents
- **Content Creation**: Use `content-creator`, `thread-crafter`, or `base` agents
- **Analysis Tasks**: Use `analytical-writer` or specialized analysis agents
- **Fact Checking**: Use `fact-checker` agents for verification tasks

### Resource Management
- **Optimal Agent Count**: 3-10 agents for most tasks
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute tasks evenly across agents
- **Error Handling**: Implement fallback mechanisms for failed agents
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion rates and adjust as needed

### Quality Control
- **Consistency Checks**: Ensure all agents follow similar quality standards
- **Cross-Validation**: Have multiple agents verify critical information
- **Output Standardization**: Maintain consistent formatting across all agents
- **Deduplication**: Remove redundant information from multiple agents

## Performance Optimization

### Parallel Processing Efficiency
- **Task Granularity**: Break tasks into appropriately sized chunks
- **Agent Specialization**: Use agents optimized for specific task types
- **Resource Allocation**: Balance agent count with available resources
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track completion rates and adjust as needed

### Quality Assurance
- **Cross-Validation**: Have multiple agents verify critical information
- **Consistency Checks**: Ensure uniform quality across all agents
- **Error Detection**: Identify and resolve inconsistencies or errors
- **Output Standardization**: Maintain consistent formatting and structure

## Error Handling

### Agent Failure Recovery
- **Automatic Retry**: Re-spawn failed agents with modified parameters
- **Alternative Agents**: Use backup agent types for critical tasks
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with partial results if some agents fail
- **Error Reporting**: Provide detailed error information for debugging

### Quality Assurance Failures
- **Cross-Validation**: Use multiple agents to verify critical information
- **Manual Review**: Flag outputs requiring human review
- **Iterative Improvement**: Refine agent prompts based on quality issues
- **Learning Integration**: Update agent parameters based on performance data

## Advanced Patterns

### Conditional Agent Spawning
```bash
# Spawn agents based on conditions
if task_complexity == "high":
  spawn_count = 10
elif task_complexity == "medium":
  spawn_count = 5
else:
  spawn_count = 3

for i in range(spawn_count):
  Task(
    description=f"Parallel task {i+1}",
    prompt=f"Process subset {i+1} of {spawn_count} for [task_description]",
    subagent_type="appropriate_agent"
  )
```

### Hierarchical Orchestration
```bash
# Master orchestrator spawns sub-orchestrators
Task(
  description="Research orchestration",
  prompt="Orchestrate research tasks for [domain] with specialized agents",
  subagent_type="master-orchestrator"
)

Task(
  description="Content orchestration",
  prompt="Orchestrate content creation tasks for [domain] with platform-specific agents",
  subagent_type="master-orchestrator"
)
```

### Dynamic Agent Allocation
```bash
# Adjust agent count based on task progress
initial_agents = 5
if progress_slow:
  additional_agents = 3
  for i in range(additional_agents):
    Task(
      description=f"Additional agent {i+1}",
      prompt="Assist with remaining tasks to accelerate completion",
      subagent_type="appropriate_agent"
    )
```
