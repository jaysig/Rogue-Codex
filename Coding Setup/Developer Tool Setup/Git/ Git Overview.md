# Git Overview

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your projects.

## What is Version Control?

Version control systems track changes to files over time. This allows you to:
- See what changed, when, and who made the changes
- Revert files or entire projects to previous states
- Compare changes over time
- Collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work
- Create separate branches for features or experiments

## Why Git?

Git is the most popular version control system because it's:
- **Distributed**: Every developer has a complete history of the project
- **Fast**: Operations are performed locally and optimized for speed
- **Reliable**: Strong safeguards against corruption and data loss
- **Flexible**: Supports many different workflows and project structures
- **Industry Standard**: Used by most open source projects and companies
