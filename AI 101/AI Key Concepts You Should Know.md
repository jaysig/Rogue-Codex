# AI Key Concepts You Should Know

**Essential terms explained in plain English for AI beginners**

*Understanding these concepts will help you use AI more effectively*

## Context Window: AI's "Memory"

### What It Is
The context window is how much information AI can "remember" in a single conversation.

### Simple Analogy
Imagine AI has a notepad that can only hold a certain number of pages. Once it's full, it starts erasing the oldest pages to make room for new ones.

### Why It Matters

**Small context window** (like 4,000 words):
- AI might forget earlier parts of long conversations
- Better for short, focused questions
- Less expensive to use

**Large context window** (like 200,000 words):
- AI can remember entire long documents
- Great for analyzing full reports or books
- Can maintain context in very long conversations

### Practical Examples

**Small context window scenario:**
- You have a 20-minute conversation with AI
- You ask about something from the beginning
- AI says "I don't see that information" because it "forgot"

**Large context window scenario:**
- You upload a 50-page document
- AI can answer questions about any part of it
- It remembers connections between different sections

### What You Should Do
- **For quick questions**: Any AI works fine
- **For long conversations**: Choose AI with larger context windows
- **If AI "forgets"**: Just remind it of the important details

## Tokens: How AI "Reads"

### What They Are
Tokens are small pieces of text that AI processes. Think of them as AI's way of breaking down language.

### Simple Breakdown
- **1 token** ≈ 3/4 of a word in English
- **100 tokens** ≈ 75 words (about 3-4 sentences)
- **1,000 tokens** ≈ 750 words (about 3 paragraphs)

### Examples of Token Counting

**Short message (about 20 tokens):**
"Please help me write a thank you email."

**Medium message (about 100 tokens):**
"I need help writing a professional thank you email to my boss after she gave me a promotion. I want to sound grateful but not too casual. Can you help me with the right tone and structure?"

**Long message (about 500 tokens):**
A full paragraph explaining your background, the situation, what kind of help you need, specific requirements, and examples of what you're looking for.

### Why Tokens Matter

**Cost**: Many AI services charge by tokens
- More tokens = higher cost
- Longer conversations cost more

**Speed**: More tokens take longer to process
- Simple questions get faster responses
- Complex requests with lots of context take more time

**Limits**: Each AI has token limits per conversation
- Stay within the limit for best results
- Very long requests might get cut off

### Practical Tips
- Be specific but concise in your requests
- Don't add unnecessary background information
- Break very complex requests into smaller parts

## Training Data: What AI Has "Read"

### What It Is
Training data is all the text the AI learned from before it was released to the public.

### What's Typically Included
- Books and literature
- Wikipedia and reference materials
- News articles and journals
- Academic papers and research
- Websites and forums
- Some social media content

### Important Limitations

**Knowledge Cutoff Date:**
- AI only knows information up to when it was trained
- Usually 6-12 months behind current events
- Can't tell you about very recent news or changes

**No Real-Time Updates:**
- AI can't browse the internet (except specialized tools)
- Doesn't learn new information after training
- Won't know about events after its cutoff date

**Potential Biases:**
- AI reflects the perspectives in its training data
- May have biases present in source materials
- Important to think critically about responses

### Examples of What This Means

**AI might know:**
- Historical facts and established science
- Classic literature and well-known concepts
- General advice and common knowledge

**AI might not know:**
- This week's news events
- Very recent scientific discoveries
- Brand new products or companies
- Changes in laws or policies from recent months

### How to Work With These Limitations
- Ask AI about its knowledge cutoff date for important topics
- Verify recent facts with current sources
- Use search-powered AI (like Perplexity) for current information
- Provide recent context if it's important for your question

## How These Concepts Work Together

### Planning Your AI Conversation

**For simple questions:**
- Any AI works fine
- Don't worry much about tokens or context

**For complex projects:**
- Choose AI with large context window
- Be mindful of token costs
- Understand what AI might not know about recent events

**For research on current topics:**
- Use search-powered AI
- Or provide recent context to regular AI
- Double-check important facts

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Writing Help
**Good approach:**
- Use any AI for general writing advice
- Provide specific context about your audience
- Ask for feedback and improvements

**Consider:** You won't use many tokens, so cost isn't a big concern.

### Example 2: Analyzing a Long Document
**Good approach:**
- Choose AI with large context window
- Upload or paste the full document
- Ask specific questions about different sections

**Consider:** This will use many tokens but gives you comprehensive analysis.

### Example 3: Current Events Research
**Good approach:**
- Use Perplexity or similar search-powered AI
- Ask for recent sources and verification
- Cross-check important information

**Consider:** Regular AI might have outdated information.

## Quick Reference Guide

### When Context Window Matters Most:
- Analyzing long documents
- Having extended conversations
- Working on complex, multi-part projects

### When Token Count Matters Most:
- You're paying per token
- You're doing lots of AI interactions
- You want faster responses

### When Training Data Limitations Matter Most:
- Researching current events
- Learning about recent developments
- Making decisions based on up-to-date information
