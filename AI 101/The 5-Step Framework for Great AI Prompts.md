# The 5-Step Framework for Great AI Prompts

**The most important skill for getting excellent results from any AI**

*Master this simple framework and dramatically improve your AI conversations*

## Why This Framework Works

Most people get disappointing results from AI because they ask vague questions. This 5-step framework forces you to be specific about exactly what you want, which helps AI give you much better responses.

**Research shows:** Structured prompts following this framework get significantly better results than casual requests.

## The 5 Steps (Easy to Remember)

### 1. Define a Role
### 2. Define Your Inputs  
### 3. Define the Steps
### 4. Define the Output
### 5. Any Restrictions

Let's break down each step with examples:

---

## Step 1: Define a Role

Tell the AI what expert or type of person you want it to be.

### Why This Works
- Helps AI understand what tone and expertise level to use
- Sets expectations for the type of advice you want
- Makes responses more focused and relevant

### Good Examples:
- "You are a high school math teacher"
- "You are a professional chef with 10 years of experience"
- "You are a small business marketing expert"
- "You are a career counselor helping college students"
- "You are a friendly tutor who explains things simply"

### Avoid Being Too Vague:
❌ "You are an expert"
❌ "You are helpful"
✅ "You are a personal finance advisor specializing in helping young professionals"

---

## Step 2: Define Your Inputs

Give the AI all the information it needs to help you.

### Why This Works
- Context helps AI give personalized advice instead of generic responses
- Prevents AI from making wrong assumptions about your situation
- Leads to more relevant and useful suggestions

### What to Include:
- Your background or situation
- What you're trying to achieve
- Any constraints or limitations you have
- Relevant details about your audience or environment

### Good Examples:
- "I'm a college student studying biology and preparing for medical school"
- "I run a small online jewelry business with a $500 monthly marketing budget"
- "I'm interviewing for entry-level software engineering positions"
- "I'm a teacher planning lessons for 9th grade English students"

### Don't Forget Important Context:
❌ "I need help with my presentation"
✅ "I need help with my 10-minute presentation to convince my school board to approve a new library program. My audience includes parents, teachers, and school administrators."

---

## Step 3: Define the Steps

Break down complex tasks into clear steps for AI to follow.

### Why This Works
- Helps AI organize its thinking
- Ensures AI covers all important aspects
- Makes responses more thorough and systematic
- Easier for you to follow and implement

### Good Examples:
- "First analyze my current situation, then identify problems, then suggest solutions"
- "Start with brainstorming ideas, then organize them by priority, then create an action plan"
- "Begin by explaining the concept, then provide examples, then suggest practice exercises"
- "Research the topic, summarize key points, then make specific recommendations"

### For Simple Tasks:
Even simple requests benefit from structure:
❌ "Help me write an email"
✅ "First help me identify the key message, then write a draft, then suggest improvements"

---

## Step 4: Define the Output

Be specific about exactly what you want to receive.

### Why This Works
- Prevents AI from giving you information in unhelpful formats
- Saves time by getting exactly what you need
- Makes responses easier to use and implement

### Format Options:
- **Lists**: "Give me a numbered list with 5 items"
- **Summaries**: "Write a 2-paragraph summary"
- **Tables**: "Create a table with pros and cons"
- **Examples**: "Provide 3 specific examples with explanations"
- **Step-by-step guides**: "Give me a checklist I can follow"
- **Templates**: "Create a template I can customize"

### Good Examples:
- "Give me a bullet-point list with 7 specific actions I can take this week"
- "Write a 3-paragraph explanation suitable for middle school students"
- "Create a comparison table showing the pros and cons of each option"
- "Provide a step-by-step guide with estimated time for each step"

---

## Step 5: Any Restrictions

Tell the AI what to avoid or limit.

### Why This Works
- Keeps AI focused on what's most important
- Prevents irrelevant or unhelpful information
- Ensures responses match your specific needs and constraints

### Common Restrictions:
- **Audience level**: "Keep language simple for beginners"
- **Length**: "Limit response to 200 words"
- **Budget**: "Focus only on free or low-cost options"
- **Time**: "Only suggest things I can do in 30 minutes or less"
- **Resources**: "Don't recommend anything requiring special software"
- **Complexity**: "Avoid technical jargon"

### Good Examples:
- "Keep the language simple for a middle school audience"
- "Focus only on strategies that cost less than $100"
- "Don't include any solutions that require hiring additional staff"
- "Avoid recommending anything that takes more than 2 hours to implement"

---

## Complete Example: Before and After

### ❌ Bad Prompt (Vague):
"Help me with marketing for my business"

### ✅ Good Prompt (Using 5-Step Framework):

**[ROLE]** You are a marketing expert who specializes in helping small local businesses.

**[INPUTS]** I run a small bakery in a college town. I make custom cakes and cupcakes, and most of my customers are students and local families. I've been open for 6 months and currently get about 20 customers per day. I have a limited budget of about $200 per month for marketing.

**[STEPS]** Please help me by: 1) Identifying my target audience more specifically, 2) Suggesting affordable marketing strategies that would work for my situation, 3) Prioritizing which strategies I should try first based on likely impact and ease of implementation.

**[OUTPUT]** Give me a numbered list with specific action steps I can take this month, including estimated costs and time required for each.

**[RESTRICTIONS]** Focus only on strategies that cost less than $50 per month each and don't require advanced technical skills or hiring additional help.

### Results Comparison:

**Bad prompt results**: Generic marketing advice that could apply to any business
**Good prompt results**: Specific, actionable advice tailored to a college town bakery with a small budget

## Practice Exercise

Try this framework with a real problem you're facing:

### Template to Fill Out:
```
[ROLE] You are a _________________ with expertise in _________________.

[INPUTS] [Describe your situation, background, and what you're trying to achieve]

[STEPS] Please help me by: 1) _________________, 2) _________________, 3) _________________.

[OUTPUT] [Specify exactly what format you want - list, paragraph, table, etc.]

[RESTRICTIONS] [List any limitations, constraints, or things to avoid]
```

### Quick Examples for Different Needs:

**For learning something new:**
- Role: Patient tutor in [subject]
- Steps: Explain basics → provide examples → suggest practice
- Output: Step-by-step learning plan
- Restrictions: Keep it simple for beginners

**For solving a problem:**
- Role: Expert consultant in [relevant field] 
- Steps: Analyze situation → identify options → recommend best approach
- Output: Specific recommendations with rationale
- Restrictions: Focus on realistic solutions within your constraints

**For creative projects:**

- Steps: Brainstorm ideas → organize by feasibility → provide detailed plan
- Output: Creative brief with action steps
- Restrictions: Match your skill level and available resources

## Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

### Mistake 1: Role Too Generic
❌ "You are an expert"
✅ "You are a small business financial advisor"

### Mistake 2: Missing Important Context
❌ "Help me prepare for an interview"
✅ "Help me prepare for a software engineering interview at a startup. I'm a recent college graduate with internship experience but no full-time work experience."

### Mistake 3: Unclear Output Request
❌ "Give me some ideas"
✅ "Give me 5 specific ideas in a numbered list, with a brief explanation of why each one would work for my situation"

### Mistake 4: No Restrictions
❌ (No restrictions provided)
✅ "Focus only on free or low-cost solutions that don't require technical expertise"

## Advanced Tips

### Build on Responses
After getting a good response, you can:
- "Can you elaborate on point #3?"
- "What are some potential problems with approach #2?"
- "Can you give me a specific example of how to implement the first recommendation?"

### Iterate and Improve
- "This is helpful, but can you make it more specific to my situation?"
- "Can you simplify this for someone who's never done this before?"
- "What would you change if my budget was only $50 instead of $200?"

### Ask for Different Perspectives
- "Now give me the same advice but from the perspective of someone who's very risk-averse"
- "What would someone with 20 years of experience say about this approach?"
