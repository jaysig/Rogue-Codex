# Multi-Agent Overview

Techniques for spawning and orchestrating multiple AI agents to work on complex tasks simultaneously, without requiring Git worktrees or separate repositories.

## What is Multi-Agent Orchestration?

Multi-agent orchestration involves running multiple AI agents simultaneously to handle different aspects of complex tasks. Unlike Git worktrees which provide repository isolation, multi-agent systems focus on task division and coordination within the same working environment.

## Core Concepts

### Agent Types
- **Coordinator Agent**: Main agent that manages task distribution and result integration
- **Worker Agents**: Specialized agents that handle specific subtasks
- **Sub-Agents**: Temporary agents spawned for particular operations

### Coordination Patterns
- **Task Delegation**: Main agent assigns specific tasks to sub-agents
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects
- **Result Aggregation**: Coordinator combines outputs from multiple agents

## Agent Spawning Methods

### Sub-Agent Delegation (Claude Code)
Claude Code's built-in Task tool enables spawning sub-agents for parallel operations:
- Sub-agents have same tool access as main agent
- Cannot spawn further sub-tasks (one level deep)
- Results automatically reported back to coordinator
- Asynchronous execution allows multiple concurrent sub-agents

### External Agent Management
Tools and frameworks for managing multiple AI agents:
- **Claude Squad**: Terminal interface for multiple AI agents
- **Async Code**: UI for parallel AI agent management
- **Custom Scripts**: Automated agent spawning and coordination

## Benefits of Multi-Agent Approaches

### Parallel Processing
- Multiple tasks executed simultaneously
- Reduced overall completion time
- Better resource utilization

### Specialization
- Different agents can focus on specific domains
- Optimized prompts and contexts for particular tasks
- Better quality results through specialization

### Scalability
- Add more agents for complex projects
- Dynamic scaling based on workload
- Horizontal scaling without infrastructure changes

## Common Multi-Agent Patterns

### Feature Development
```
Coordinator Agent
├── Implementation Agent (writes code)
├── Testing Agent (creates tests)
├── Documentation Agent (writes docs)
└── Review Agent (quality checks)
```

### Research and Analysis
```
Coordinator Agent
├── Data Collection Agent
├── Analysis Agent
├── Visualization Agent
└── Report Generation Agent
```

### Content Creation
```
Coordinator Agent  
├── Research Agent (gathers information)
├── Writing Agent (creates content)
├── Editing Agent (reviews and improves)
└── SEO Agent (optimizes for search)
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Efficiency Gains
- **90.2% better performance** than single agent (Anthropic internal testing)
- Optimal coordinator/worker ratio: Claude Opus 4 + Claude Sonnet 4 sub-agents
- Significant time savings for complex, multi-faceted tasks

### Resource Considerations
- **15× more token usage** compared to single agent chats
- Memory overhead for multiple agent contexts
- Network bandwidth for multiple concurrent API calls
- Practical limit: ~10 agents simultaneously

## Implementation Strategies

### Starting Simple
1. **Two-Agent Setup**: Coordinator + one specialized worker
2. **Task-Specific Agents**: Create agents for specific, well-defined tasks
3. **Gradual Scaling**: Add more agents as complexity increases

### Coordination Techniques
- **Clear Role Definition**: Each agent has specific responsibilities
- **Communication Protocols**: Structured information exchange
- **Error Handling**: Fallback procedures for agent failures
- **Result Integration**: Methods for combining agent outputs

## Best Practices

### Agent Design
- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent focuses on one primary task
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined inputs and expected outputs
- **Context Management**: Efficient sharing of relevant information
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of agent failures

### Resource Management
- **Token Budget Planning**: Account for 15× usage increase
- **Concurrent Limits**: Stay within system and API limits
- **Monitoring**: Track agent performance and resource usage
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work effectively across agents

### Quality Assurance
- **Output Validation**: Verify agent results before integration
- **Consistency Checks**: Ensure coherent results across agents
- **Review Processes**: Human oversight for critical decisions
- **Feedback Loops**: Improve agent performance over time

## Tools and Platforms

### Claude Code Native
- **Task Tool**: Built-in sub-agent spawning capability
- **Tool Access**: Sub-agents inherit parent agent's tool permissions
- **Result Reporting**: Automatic coordination of sub-agent outputs

### Third-Party Solutions
- **Claude Squad**: Multi-agent terminal management
- **Async Code**: Visual interface for parallel agent coordination
- **Custom APIs**: Build tailored multi-agent systems

### Container-Based Deployment
- **Docker Containers**: Isolated agent environments
- **Kubernetes**: Scalable agent orchestration
- **Cloud Functions**: Serverless agent deployment
- **Resource Limits**: CPU and memory controls per agent

## Advanced Orchestration

### Dynamic Agent Creation
- Spawn agents based on task requirements
- Adaptive scaling for varying workloads
- Just-in-time agent provisioning

### Hierarchical Structures
```
Master Coordinator
├── Feature Coordinator
│   ├── Frontend Agent
│   └── Backend Agent
└── Testing Coordinator
    ├── Unit Test Agent
    └── Integration Test Agent
```

### Cross-Agent Communication
- **Message Passing**: Structured communication between agents
- **Shared Context**: Common knowledge base for all agents
- **Event Systems**: Reactive agent coordination
- **Workflow Engines**: Formal process definition and execution

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Agent Performance
- Response times and throughput metrics
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Success/failure rates by agent type
- Resource utilization monitoring

### Debugging Techniques
- **Agent Logs**: Detailed execution traces
- **Communication Tracking**: Monitor inter-agent messaging
- **State Inspection**: Agent context and variable examination
- **Workflow Visualization**: Visual representation of agent interactions

## Future Developments

### Enhanced Autonomy
- Agents that spawn other agents as needed
- Self-organizing agent networks
- Adaptive coordination strategies

### Improved Efficiency
- Better resource management and optimization
- Reduced token usage through smarter coordination
- Enhanced parallel processing capabilities
