- **Recovery**: Adequate rest and recovery between sessions
- **Individualization**: Adapt training to personal needs and limitations
- **Mental Preparation**: Develop mental toughness alongside physical fitness

### Selection Preparation
- **Research Requirements**: Understand specific selection standards
- **Simulate Conditions**: Practice in realistic selection environments
- **Test Equipment**: Ensure all gear works properly
- **Mental Rehearsal**: Visualize success in selection events
- **Build Confidence**: Develop belief in ability to succeed

### Professional Standards
- **Safety First**: Prioritize safety in all training activities
- **Medical Clearance**: Ensure medical clearance for intense training
