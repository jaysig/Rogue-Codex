## Installation

### Project Installation (Recommended)
```json
// .mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-plus": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memory-plus"],
      "env": {
        "MEMORY_PLUS_DATA_PATH": ".claude/memory-plus.json",
        "MEMORY_PLUS_MAX_SIZE": "50MB"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Global Installation
```bash
# Install the package
npm install -g memory-plus

# Add to global MCP configuration
claude mcp add memory-plus -- memory-plus --data-path ~/.claude/memory-plus.json
```

## Use Cases

### Advanced Context Management
- Complex project context retention across long sessions
- Intelligent relationship mapping between documentation sections
- Pattern recognition for content creation workflows
- Advanced search and retrieval of historical context

### Knowledge Organization
- Automatic categorization of information by topic and relevance
- Relationship mapping between companies, tools, and concepts
- Intelligent content recommendations based on usage patterns
- Dynamic knowledge graph construction and maintenance

### Workflow Optimization
- Learning from successful documentation patterns
- Intelligent suggestion of relevant past content
- Optimization recommendations based on usage analytics
- Adaptive context prioritization for different tasks

## Typical Workflows

1. **Pattern Learning**: "Learn from my tool evaluation process to optimize future evaluations"
2. **Context Retrieval**: "Find all related information about AI automation companies we've documented"
3. **Relationship Mapping**: "Show me the connections between productivity tools and their target industries"
4. **Workflow Analysis**: "Analyze my content creation patterns and suggest optimizations"

## Configuration Options

Environment variables:
- `MEMORY_PLUS_DATA_PATH`: Storage location for memory data
- `MEMORY_PLUS_MAX_SIZE`: Maximum memory storage size
- `MEMORY_PLUS_RETENTION_DAYS`: Data retention period
- `MEMORY_PLUS_ANALYTICS`: Enable/disable analytics features

Advanced settings:
- Pattern recognition sensitivity
- Context prioritization algorithms
- Knowledge graph relationship scoring
- Memory optimization schedules

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: All memory data stored locally in project directories
- **Access Control**: Implement appropriate file permissions for memory storage
- **Data Retention**: Configure appropriate retention policies
- **Backup Management**: Regular backup of critical memory data
- **Audit Trail**: Monitor memory access and modification patterns

## Advantages over Standard Memory

**Memory Plus:**
- Advanced pattern recognition and learning
- Sophisticated relationship mapping
- Analytics and optimization insights
- Selective memory and intelligent filtering
- Cross-session pattern learning

**Standard Memory:**
- Simple key-value storage
