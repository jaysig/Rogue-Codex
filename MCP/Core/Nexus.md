## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Install the package
npm install -g nexus-mcp

# Add to global MCP configuration
claude mcp add nexus -- nexus-mcp --config ~/.claude/nexus-config.json
```

### Project Installation
```json
// .mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nexus": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "nexus-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "NEXUS_CONFIG_PATH": ".claude/nexus-config.json",
        "NEXUS_MONITORING": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### MCP Infrastructure Management
- Centralized monitoring of all Rogue Codex MCP servers
- Load balancing between multiple instances of high-usage servers
- Automated failover for critical documentation workflows
- Performance optimization across the entire MCP ecosystem

### Workflow Orchestration
- Coordinate complex workflows involving multiple MCP servers
- Intelligent routing of requests to appropriate specialized servers
- Resource optimization based on server capabilities and load
- Automated scaling of server instances based on demand

### Development & Testing
- Testing environment management for new MCP server deployments
- Performance benchmarking across different server configurations
- Development workflow optimization
- Staged deployment of MCP server updates

## Typical Workflows

1. **Server Health Check**: "Show me the status of all MCP servers in our setup"
2. **Performance Optimization**: "Optimize the routing between our documentation and research servers"
3. **Load Management**: "Balance the load between our web scraping and content analysis servers"
4. **Failover Testing**: "Test the failover mechanism for our critical MCP servers"

## Configuration Requirements

Configuration file structure:
```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "name": "puppeteer-server",
      "priority": "high",
      "failover": "playwright-server",
      "healthCheck": "/health"
    }
  ],
  "routing": {
    "rules": [],
    "loadBalancing": "round-robin"
  },
  "monitoring": {
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": 30
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Access Control**: Secure access to orchestration controls
- **Server Authentication**: Validate all managed server connections
- **Configuration Security**: Protect centralized configuration data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of orchestration activities
- **Failover Security**: Secure failover mechanisms and data integrity

## Monitoring & Analytics

- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, and error rates
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and network utilization
- **Health Status**: Real-time server health and availability
- **Usage Patterns**: Analysis of request patterns and server utilization
- **Optimization Recommendations**: Automated suggestions for improvement

## Integration Benefits

- **Simplified Management**: Single point of control for multiple servers
- **Improved Reliability**: Automated failover and health monitoring
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent routing and load balancing
- **Scalability**: Easy scaling of server infrastructure
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and analytics
