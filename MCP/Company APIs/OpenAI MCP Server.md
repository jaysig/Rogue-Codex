# OpenAI MCP Server

**Repository:** https://github.com/pierrebrunelle/mcp-server-openai  
**Category:** Company APIs  
**Scope:** Local (recommended)  
**Type:** AI Language Model Integration

OpenAI MCP Server enables Claude Code to interact with OpenAI's APIs, providing access to GPT models, embeddings, and other OpenAI services for enhanced AI-powered workflows.

## Key Features

- **GPT Model Access**: Integrate with GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and other OpenAI models
- **Embeddings Generation**: Create embeddings for semantic search and analysis
- **Text Processing**: Advanced text generation, summarization, and analysis
- **Model Comparison**: Compare outputs from different OpenAI models
- **Custom Instructions**: Use system prompts and custom configurations
- **Streaming Support**: Handle real-time streaming responses

## Installation

### Local Installation (Recommended for API Keys)
```json
// .claude/settings.local.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-server-openai"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}",
        "OPENAI_ORGANIZATION": "${OPENAI_ORGANIZATION}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

### Content Enhancement
- Generate alternative content variations for comparison
- Create summaries and abstracts for long-form content
- Enhance content with AI-generated insights and analysis
- Develop content optimization recommendations

### Research & Analysis
- Process and analyze large volumes of text data
- Generate embeddings for semantic search capabilities
- Create content similarity analysis and recommendations
- Develop AI-powered content categorization

### Workflow Automation
- Automate content generation for repetitive tasks
- Create intelligent content processing pipelines
- Generate structured data from unstructured text
- Develop AI-assisted editing and review processes

## Typical Workflows

1. **Content Analysis**: "Analyze this company description and suggest improvements"
2. **Embedding Generation**: "Create embeddings for all tool descriptions for similarity search"
3. **Content Variation**: "Generate alternative descriptions for this tool using different models"
4. **Research Summarization**: "Summarize these industry reports into key insights"

## Configuration Requirements

Required environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API key
- `OPENAI_ORGANIZATION`: Organization ID (optional)

Model configuration:
- Default model selection (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.)
- Temperature and creativity settings
- Token limits and response constraints

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Security**: Store keys securely in environment variables
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track API usage and costs
- **Data Privacy**: Be aware of data sent to OpenAI services
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect OpenAI's API rate limits
- **Content Filtering**: Consider OpenAI's content policies

## Cost Management

- **Token Monitoring**: Track token usage across different models
- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for different tasks
- **Batch Processing**: Optimize requests for cost efficiency
- **Usage Limits**: Set appropriate usage limits and alerts

## Model Capabilities

- **GPT-4**: Advanced reasoning, analysis, and complex tasks
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: Fast, cost-effective text generation
- **Text-embedding-ada-002**: High-quality embeddings for search
- **GPT-4-turbo**: Optimized for longer context and faster processing

## Related Tools

- **Context7 MCP**: Complementary knowledge search and retrieval
- **Perplexity Search**: Alternative AI-powered research capabilities
- **JSON MCP**: For processing structured AI responses

## Rogue Codex Applications

**Medium Value for:**
- Content variation and optimization for different audiences
- AI-assisted research and analysis for company and tool profiles
- Embedding generation for semantic search across documentation
- Automated content enhancement and editing assistance

**Considerations:**
- **Cost Management**: OpenAI API usage incurs direct costs
- **Data Privacy**: Content sent to OpenAI for processing
- **Redundancy**: May overlap with Claude Code's existing capabilities
- **Specialization**: Most valuable for specific use cases requiring OpenAI models

**Best Use Cases:**
- Teams requiring specific OpenAI model capabilities
- Workflows needing embeddings for semantic search
- Organizations with existing OpenAI infrastructure
- Use cases requiring model comparison and evaluation

**Recommended Priority**: Low-Medium - Useful for specific workflows but may duplicate existing Claude Code capabilities.
