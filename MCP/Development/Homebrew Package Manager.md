## Integration Examples

### Conversational Package Management
```
User: "Install the latest version of Node.js and Python"
AI: Uses brew install to install node and python packages
Result: Both packages installed with version confirmation
```

### System Health Check
```
User: "Check if my system needs any updates"
AI: Runs brew doctor and brew outdated
Result: Comprehensive system health report with recommendations
```

### Development Setup
```
User: "Set up a web development environment"
AI: Installs git, node, npm, code editors, and development tools
Result: Complete development environment ready for use
```

## Configuration Options

### Logging Configuration
- **Log File**: All operations logged to `homebrew_mcp.log`
- **Request Tracking**: Complete history of all package operations
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### Safety Features
- **Confirmation Prompts**: AI can ask for confirmation on destructive operations
- **Dry Run Options**: Preview changes before execution
- **Rollback Capability**: Uninstall recently installed packages if needed

## Workflow Integration

### Automated Development Setup
1. **Environment Detection**: Analyze project requirements
2. **Package Planning**: Determine required tools and dependencies
3. **Batch Installation**: Install all required packages efficiently
4. **Verification**: Confirm successful installation and configuration

### System Maintenance Routine
1. **Health Check**: Run brew doctor for system issues
2. **Update Check**: Identify outdated packages
3. **Selective Updates**: Update critical packages first
4. **Cleanup**: Remove old versions and clear cache

## Best Practices

### Package Management
