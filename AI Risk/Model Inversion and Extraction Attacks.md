# Model Inversion and Extraction Attacks: Stealing Information from AI Systems

Model inversion and extraction attacks target trained AI models to steal sensitive information, including training data, model parameters, and proprietary algorithms. These attacks pose significant privacy and intellectual property risks as AI systems become more valuable and widely deployed.

## What Are Model Inversion and Extraction Attacks?
