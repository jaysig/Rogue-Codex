# AI System Backdoors and Trojans: Hidden Vulnerabilities in AI Systems

AI system backdoors and trojans are hidden vulnerabilities embedded in AI systems that can be activated by specific triggers. These backdoors allow unauthorized access and control over AI systems, often inserted during development or training phases, making them extremely difficult to detect and remove.
