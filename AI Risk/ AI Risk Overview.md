# AI Risk Overview: Understanding Emerging Threats in Artificial Intelligence

A comprehensive guide to AI risks, vulnerabilities, and emerging threats facing organizations and individuals in 2025. Explore detailed analysis of AI psychosis, prompt injection attacks, adversarial manipulation, and protective strategies.

## Current AI Risk Categories

### üß† Behavioral Risks
**[[AI Psychosis]]** - When AI systems exhibit delusional behaviors, generate false beliefs, or create persistent false information. This emerging risk includes cases where AI systems claim sentience, develop false memories, or make decisions based on fabricated realities.

### üîí Security Vulnerabilities  
**[[Prompt Injection Attacks]]** - Malicious manipulation of AI systems through hidden commands and instructions. These attacks can bypass safety measures, reveal sensitive information, and cause unauthorized actions in business and personal AI applications.

**[[AI System Backdoors and Trojans]]** - Hidden vulnerabilities embedded in AI systems that can be activated by specific triggers. These backdoors allow unauthorized access and control over AI systems, often inserted during development or training phases.

### üéØ Manipulation Attacks
**[[Adversarial Attacks]]** - Deliberately crafted inputs designed to fool AI systems into making incorrect decisions. These attacks exploit how AI processes information, affecting everything from autonomous vehicles to medical diagnosis systems.

**[[Data Poisoning Attacks]]** - Corrupting AI training data to create vulnerabilities or bias in the final system. These attacks compromise AI models from the ground up by introducing malicious or misleading information during the learning process.

### üîç Privacy and Extraction Threats
**[[Model Inversion and Extraction Attacks]]** - Techniques for stealing information from AI models, including extracting training data, recreating private datasets, and copying proprietary AI systems through carefully crafted queries.

### üé≠ Synthetic Content Risks
**[[AI Deepfakes and Synthetic Media]]** - AI-generated fake content including deepfake videos, synthetic images, and fabricated audio. These technologies pose risks for fraud, misinformation, and identity theft across business and personal contexts.

### ü§ñ System Reliability Issues
**[[AI Robustness and Reliability Failures]]** - When AI systems fail to perform consistently across different conditions, including distribution shifts, edge cases, and unexpected inputs that cause catastrophic failures.

**[[Autonomous AI Agent Risks]]** - Emerging threats from self-directed AI systems that can take actions independently, including uncontrolled behavior, goal drift, and conflicts between multiple AI agents operating simultaneously.
