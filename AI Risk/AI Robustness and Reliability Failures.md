# AI Robustness and Reliability Failures: When AI Systems Break Down

AI robustness and reliability failures occur when AI systems fail to perform consistently across different conditions, including distribution shifts, edge cases, and unexpected inputs that cause catastrophic failures. These failures pose significant risks as AI systems are deployed in critical applications.

## What Are AI Robustness and Reliability Issues?

AI systems can fail in unexpected ways when they encounter conditions different from their training environment:

- **Distribution Shift**: Performance degradation when real-world data differs from training data
- **Edge Case Failures**: Breakdowns when encountering unusual or rare situations
- **Catastrophic Forgetting**: Loss of previously learned capabilities when learning new tasks
- **Brittle Performance**: Dramatic failure from small changes in input or environment

## Types of Reliability Failures

### Distribution Shift Problems
