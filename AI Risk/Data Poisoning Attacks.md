# Data Poisoning Attacks: Corrupting AI Systems at the Source

Data poisoning attacks corrupt AI training data to create vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases in the final system. These attacks compromise AI models from the ground up by introducing malicious or misleading information during the learning process, making them particularly dangerous and hard to detect.

## What Are Data Poisoning Attacks?

Data poisoning involves deliberately corrupting the training datasets used to build AI systems. Unlike other attacks that target deployed systems, poisoning attacks happen during the development phase, making them:

- **Foundational**: Built into the core of the AI system
- **Persistent**: Nearly impossible to remove without retraining
- **Subtle**: Often undetectable until activated
- **Widespread**: Affecting all uses of the poisoned model

## Types of Data Poisoning

### Availability Attacks
- **Goal**: Make the AI system unreliable or completely unusable
- **Method**: Introducing noise, incorrect labels, or corrupted data
- **Impact**: Reduced accuracy, increased error rates, system failures
- **Example**: Adding mislabeled images to make an image classifier fail

### Targeted Poisoning
- **Goal**: Cause specific misclassifications for chosen inputs
- **Method**: Crafting training examples that create targeted vulnerabilities
- **Impact**: System works normally except for specific trigger conditions
- **Example**: Making a spam filter allow certain malicious emails through

### Backdoor Attacks
- **Goal**: Install hidden triggers that activate malicious behavior
- **Method**: Embedding trigger patterns in training data with false labels
- **Impact**: Normal operation until trigger is encountered
- **Example**: Making a facial recognition system fail for people wearing specific accessories

### Clean-Label Poisoning
- **Goal**: Create backdoors without obviously corrupted training labels
- **Method**: Subtly modifying training examples while keeping correct labels
- **Impact**: Extremely hard to detect, passes data quality checks
- **Example**: Slightly altering traffic sign images to create invisible triggers
