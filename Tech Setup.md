---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Configure Obsidian (Optional but Recommended)

These settings will make your experience much better:

### Enable Useful Features:
1. Click the **gear icon** (‚öôÔ∏è) in the bottom left
2. Go to **"Core plugins"**
3. Make sure these are enabled (toggle them on):
   - ‚úÖ **File explorer**
   - ‚úÖ **Search**
   - ‚úÖ **Graph view**
   - ‚úÖ **Backlinks**
   - ‚úÖ **Tag pane**

### Appearance Settings:
1. In Settings, go to **"Appearance"**
2. Choose a **theme** you like (Dark mode is popular)
3. Adjust **font size** if needed

## ü§ñ Step 6: Set Up AI Fitness Guide (Optional)

To use the AI-powered fitness features, you'll need Claude Code.

### Why Claude Code?
- Powers the conversational fitness tracking
- Understands natural language ("Just did squats 225x5")
- Routes you to specialized fitness coaches
- Generates workout plans and nutrition advice

### Using Without Claude Code:
You can still use all the fitness templates and guides manually - they're just regular markdown files you can edit in Obsidian!

---

## üöÄ Step 7: Start Using Rogue Codex

### First Things to Try:

1. **Explore the Structure**:
   - Click on **README.md** files in each section
   - Use the **graph view** to see how everything connects

2. **For Fitness Users**:
   - Open `Fitness Guide/README.md`
   - Check out `Fitness Guide/User_Interaction_Guide.md`
   - Try the demo files in `Fitness Guide/References/Demo/`

3. **For General Knowledge Management**:
   - Explore `Lessons Learned/` for templates
   - Check out `Tools/` for software evaluations
   - Browse `Company Registry/` for business research

### Navigation Tips:
- **Ctrl+O** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+O** (Mac): Quick file search
- **Ctrl+Shift+F** or **Cmd+Shift+F**: Search all content
- **Ctrl+G** or **Cmd+G**: Open graph view
- Click **[[links]]** to jump between notes

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Package manager installation failed"
- **Mac**: Make sure you have Xcode command line tools: `xcode-select --install`
- **Windows**: Make sure you ran PowerShell as Administrator
- **Linux**: Update your package lists first: `sudo apt update`

### "Git command not found"
- Restart your terminal after installing Git
- On Windows, you may need to restart your computer
- Verify installation: `git --version`

### "I can't see the files in Obsidian"
- Make sure you selected the correct folder when opening the vault
- The folder should contain README.md and other markdown files
- If you used Git clone, the files are in a subfolder

### "Links aren't working"
- This is normal if you moved files around
- Obsidian will show broken links - you can fix them or ignore them

### "The fitness guide isn't responding"
- The AI features require Claude Code to be set up
- You can still use all the templates manually

### "Obsidian won't open"
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or check security settings (Mac)
- Make sure you downloaded from the official obsidian.md website

### "Terminal/Command Prompt issues"
- **Mac**: Try iTerm2 if regular Terminal has issues
- **Windows**: Use Windows Terminal or PowerShell instead of Command Prompt
- **Linux**: Make sure you're using bash or zsh shell
