# Fitness Lessons Learned

Key insights and strategies for training and physical development.

## Safety

**Be careful with sandbags despite "safe" marketing** - Sandbags can still cause significant injury when dropped, despite being marketed as safer than traditional weights.

**Sandbags aren't always safer than other equipment** - While they may be safer in some contexts, they can still break bones or cause injury when mishandled.

**Maintain focus during sandbag training** - The perceived safety can lead to complacency; treat sandbags with the same caution as any heavy training equipment.
