## Program Notes

### What's Working
- Overhead press responding well to higher frequency
- Squat depth and consistency improving
- Recovery between sessions adequate

### Areas for Improvement
- Bench press stalling - may need form work
- Deadlift grip starting to limit on high reps
- Need to be more consistent with assistance work

### Modifications Made
- Added extra grip work on deadlift days
- Switched from close-grip bench to dips (shoulder comfort)
- Increased face pull volume for rear delt health

### After Program Completion
- Test new 1RMs in week 12
- Consider 5/3/1 BBB (Boring But Big) for hypertrophy focus
- Or continue with 5/3/1 with higher training maxes
