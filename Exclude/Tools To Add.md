### Hunyuan - World Models
https://the-decoder.com/tencent-releases-hunyuan-world-model-1-0-as-an-open-source-ai-for-3d-scene-generation/ 
Context "The [company says](https://3d-models.hunyuan.tencent.com/world/) it's the first open-source model designed for standard graphics pipelines, making it compatible with game engines, VR platforms, and simulation tools. The goal is to help creators move quickly from concept to 3D content without running into proprietary barriers.

A key feature is the model's ability to separate objects within a scene, letting users move or edit elements like cars, trees, or furniture individually. The sky is also isolated and can be used as a dynamic lighting source to help with realistic rendering and interactive experiences.

Hunyuan World Model 1.0 combines panoramic image generation with hierarchical 3D reconstruction. It supports two main input types: text-to-world and image-to-world. The generated scenes can be exported as mesh files and, according to Tencent, integrate smoothly into standard 3D workflows.

In practice, the model doesn't produce fully explorable 3D worlds like those in modern video games. Instead, users get interactive 360-degree panoramas. They can look around and navigate to a limited extent, but free movement is restricted. For more advanced camera movement or longer, consistent 3D video sequences, the [Voyager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04225) add-on is required, as detailed in a recent research paper.

Tencent sees these visualizations as a starting point for VR, but the model is also suitable for a wide range of interactive and creative applications. Its text interpretation is designed to map complex scene descriptions into virtual spaces accurately, and it supports various compression and acceleration techniques for web and VR environments. The architecture uses a generative, semantically layered approach, producing scenes in a range of styles for creative and design uses.

Hunyuan World Model 1.0 is available as open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanWorld-1.0) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanWorld-1). An interactive demo is also available at [sceneTo3D](https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com/sceneTo3D), but access requires a China-compatible login.

The release is part of Tencent's broader open-source push in AI. Alongside Hunyuan World Model 1.0, the company has released [Hunyuan3D 2.0](https://the-decoder.com/new-tencent-ai-model-hunyuan3d-2-0-turns-2d-images-into-detailed-3d-objects/) for textured 3D model generation, [HunyuanVideo](https://the-decoder.com/tencent-introduces-open-source-video-generator-hunyuanvideo-and-challenges-sora/) for AI-powered video, and the [Hunyuan-A13B language model with dynamic reasoning](https://the-decoder.com/tencents-open-source-model-hunyuan-a13b-combines-fast-and-slow-reasoning/)."
