   - Use "HTTP > Make a request" for custom APIs

3. **Transform and Validate**
   - Add "Tools > Set variables" for data mapping
   - Use "Filter" modules for data validation

4. **Sync and Monitor**
   - Add "Database > Insert/Update record" for sync operations
   - Use "Email > Send" for error notifications

**What You Get:**
- Real-time data synchronization across all platforms
- Elimination of manual data entry and reconciliation
- Consistent data accuracy across systems
- Automated conflict resolution and error handling
