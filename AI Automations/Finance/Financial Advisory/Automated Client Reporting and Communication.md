**Market Update Creation Prompt:**
```
Create a market update for my financial advisory clients based on this market event:

Market Event: [Describe recent market movement, Fed announcement, economic data, etc.]

Client Context:
- Typical client profile: [Age range, risk tolerance, investment goals]
- Common portfolio allocation: [% stocks, bonds, alternatives]
- Frequent client concerns: [Market volatility, retirement timing, etc.]

Create:
1. Executive summary (2-3 sentences) explaining what happened
2. Simple explanation of why it matters (avoid jargon)
3. Specific impact on typical client portfolios
4. Reassuring perspective on long-term investing
5. Any action items or recommendations
6. Invitation for questions or concerns

Tone: Professional but reassuring, educational without being condescending, confident but not dismissive of concerns.
```

**Performance Report Commentary Prompt:**
```
Help me write personalized commentary for a client's quarterly performance report:

Client Information:
- Portfolio performance: [Up/down X%]
- Benchmark comparison: [Relative performance]
- Major contributors/detractors: [Specific holdings or sectors]
- Client goals: [Retirement, income, growth, etc.]
- Time horizon: [Years to retirement or goals]
- Recent concerns: [What they've asked about recently]

Market Context:

Create commentary that:

2. Explains major portfolio changes simply
3. Addresses any likely client concerns
4. Reinforces long-term strategy alignment
5. Suggests any discussion points for next meeting

Length: 200-300 words, written at 8th grade reading level.
