## Common Questions

### "Will clients feel like they're getting automated service?"
The automation handles the tracking and follow-up scheduling, but all communications should still feel personal. Use automation to remind you when to reach out and what to discuss, not to replace personal interaction.

### "How do I maintain compliance with automated client communications?"
All templates should be reviewed by compliance before implementation. Include required disclosures in every automated communication, and maintain audit trails of all client interactions.

### "What if clients have different communication preferences?"
Build preference tracking into your CRM and use conditional logic in your automation. Some clients get automated market updates while others receive personal calls based on their preferences.

### "How do I handle complex client situations that don't fit the automation?"
Use automation for routine relationship maintenance and standard processes. Complex situations should trigger alerts for personal advisor attention rather than automated responses.
