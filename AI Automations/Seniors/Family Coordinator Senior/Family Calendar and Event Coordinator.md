You can get family event planning help without setting up automation. Perfect for planning specific celebrations:

### Simple Family Event Planning Prompt

```
I need help planning a family event. Here are the details:

Event Information:
- Type of event: [birthday party, anniversary, holiday gathering, etc.]
- Person/occasion: [who it's for and any relevant details]

Please act as a family event planning assistant and provide:

1. A simple, manageable menu suggestion
2. Decoration ideas that are easy to set up and affordable
3. Activities or entertainment appropriate for the age groups

5. A backup plan in case of weather or other issues

Keep all suggestions simple, traditional, and appropriate for a senior organizing the event independently.
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **No automatic reminders**: Need to remember to plan events manually
- **Manual planning**: Have to ask for help with each event individually
- **No family calendar integration**: Won't track birthdays or anniversaries automatically
- **One-time assistance**: Each conversation starts fresh without memory of your family preferences

**When to upgrade to AI automation:** If you coordinate multiple family events throughout the year, want automatic birthday reminders, or prefer having ongoing AI assistance that remembers your family's preferences and situation.
