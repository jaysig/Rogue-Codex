## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get activity organization help without setting up an automated system. Perfect for planning specific volunteer work or consulting opportunities:

### Simple Activity Planning Prompt

```
I want to organize my volunteer work and light consulting activities but need help creating a manageable system. Here's my situation:

Current Activities:
- Volunteer work: [describe current volunteer commitments]
- Consulting/part-time work: [describe any consulting or part-time activities]
- Other commitments: [mention other regular activities or responsibilities]

Goals and Interests:
- [describe what types of activities interest you]
- [mention how much time you want to dedicate weekly]
- [note any skills or expertise you want to use]

Concerns:
- [describe any worries about overcommitment]
- [mention any scheduling or energy constraints]
- [note any family or health considerations]

Please act as a retirement activity coordinator and:

1. Help me assess my current activity balance and capacity
2. Suggest a simple system for organizing volunteer and consulting work
3. Provide templates for tracking commitments and projects
4. Recommend ways to maintain reliable participation without stress
5. Give me strategies for saying no to overcommitment

Focus on practical, simple solutions that provide structure without complexity or overwhelm.
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **No automatic reminders**: Need to remember meetings and deadlines manually
- **Manual tracking**: Have to update project status and tasks by hand
- **No scheduling alerts**: Won't get warnings about conflicts or overcommitment
- **Static organization**: No ongoing system to manage evolving activities and commitments

**When to upgrade to simple automation:** If you have multiple regular commitments, want automatic reminders for meetings and deadlines, or need a system that helps you balance activities without having to remember everything manually.
