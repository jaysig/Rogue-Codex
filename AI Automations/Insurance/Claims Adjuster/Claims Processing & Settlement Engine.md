# Claims Processing & Settlement Engine

**What It Does:** Automatically handles the complete claims lifecycle from First Notice of Loss through settlement, focusing on the 20% of claims processing tasks that drive 80% of customer satisfaction.

**How It Works:**
1. Captures and validates First Notice of Loss (FNOL) information
2. Automatically assigns claims to appropriate adjusters based on complexity
3. Initiates investigation workflows and coordinates with third parties
4. Calculates settlement amounts and manages approval workflows
5. Generates settlement documentation and tracks closure status

**What You Need:**
- Claims management system (Guidewire, Duck Creek, Applied Epic)
- Document processing and OCR capabilities
- Third-party integrations (repair shops, medical providers)
- Payment processing and settlement systems

**Step-by-Step n8n Setup:**

1. **Create Claims Processing Workflow**
   - Start workflow called "Claims Processing & Settlement Engine"
   - Add triggers for FNOL reports (email, web forms, phone systems)

2. **FNOL Processing & Validation**
   - Add "OpenAI" node to extract claim information:
     - Policy holder details and policy number validation
     - Incident date, location, and circumstances
     - Injury or damage descriptions and severity
     - Third-party involvement and witness information
   - Validate policy coverage and deductible amounts

3. **Claim Assignment & Routing**
   - Use "Switch" node to route claims by complexity:
     - Simple claims: Automated processing track
     - Moderate claims: Junior adjuster assignment
     - Complex claims: Senior adjuster or specialist
   - Consider geography, adjuster workload, and expertise

4. **Investigation Coordination**
   - Automatically schedule property inspections and medical examinations
   - Coordinate with repair shops, contractors, and service providers
   - Request and track documentation (police reports, medical records)
   - Manage communication with all parties involved

5. **Settlement Processing**
   - Calculate settlement amounts based on coverage and estimates
   - Route settlements requiring approval through management workflow
   - Generate settlement documents and release forms
   - Process payments and update claim status to closed

**Alternative: Make.com Setup**

1. **Create Claims Management Scenario**
   - Name scenario "Claims Processing & Settlement Engine"
   - Add "Email > Watch emails" and web form triggers for FNOL

2. **AI-Powered Processing**
   - Add "OpenAI > Create a chat completion" for claim analysis
   - Extract key information and assess claim complexity
   - Validate policy coverage and calculate reserves

3. **Workflow Automation**
   - Add "Router" module for claim assignment
   - Use "Calendar > Create event" for inspection scheduling
   - Include "HTTP > Make a request" for third-party coordination

4. **Settlement Management**
   - Add "Math > Perform a function" for settlement calculations
   - Use "DocuSign > Send document" for settlement paperwork
   - Include "Payment > Process payment" for settlements

ðŸ’¡ **Make MCP Tip**: Use the [Make MCP server](https://github.com/integromat/make-mcp-server) with Claude Code to build claims processing scenarios faster.

**What You Get:**
- Streamlined claims processing from FNOL to settlement
- Consistent claim handling and faster resolution times
- Automated coordination with all parties and service providers
- 70% reduction in manual claims administration
