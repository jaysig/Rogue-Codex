A: Set up follow-up workflows to request missing information and schedule discovery calls for complex projects.

**Q: Can this work for rush projects with tight deadlines?**
A: Yes, create express workflow options for urgent projects with streamlined brief generation and faster setup.

**Q: How do I handle projects that don't fit standard templates?**
A: Build flexibility into the system with custom project type options and manual override capabilities.
