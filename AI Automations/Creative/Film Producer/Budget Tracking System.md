## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

### 1. Create Budget Monitoring Workflow
- Start new workflow called "Production Budget Tracker"
- Add "Schedule Trigger" to check expenses daily at 9 AM

### 2. Collect Expense Data Automatically
- Add "Email Trigger" to receive expense reports from crew
- Connect "Expensify" or "Ramp" for automatic expense categorization
- Use "Bank API" integration to pull transaction data
- Add "Photo OCR" node to read receipts from phone uploads

### 3. Categorize Production Expenses
- Add "Code" node to sort expenses by production department:
  - **Above-the-line**: Director, producers, main cast fees
  - **Below-the-line**: Crew wages, equipment rentals, catering
  - **Post-production**: Editing, sound mixing, color correction, VFX
  - **Marketing**: Publicity, advertising, festival submissions
- Use AI to categorize unclear expenses automatically

### 4. Compare Against Budget Allocation
- Add "Google Sheets" connection to approved production budget
- Calculate spending percentage by category in real-time
- Track burn rate and projected final costs
- Identify departments over/under budget

### 5. Create Smart Budget Alerts
- Add "IF" nodes for different alert thresholds:
  - **75% spent** = Yellow alert to department head
  - **90% spent** = Red alert to line producer
  - **Unbudgeted expense** = Immediate approval required
  - **Daily spending over target** = Cash flow warning

### 6. Generate Financial Reports
- Add "Report Generator" for weekly stakeholder updates:
  - Current spending vs. budget by department
  - Cash flow projections and funding needs
  - Cost overrun explanations and mitigation plans
  - Completion forecast based on spending trends

### 7. Stakeholder Communication
- Add "Email Automation" for different recipients:
  - **Line Producer**: Daily spending summaries and alerts
  - **Executive Producer**: Weekly financial overview
  - **Financiers**: Monthly investor reports with ROI projections
  - **Department Heads**: Real-time budget status for their areas
