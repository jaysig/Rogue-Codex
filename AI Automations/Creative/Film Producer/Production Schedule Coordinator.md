## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

### 1. Create Schedule Management Workflow
- Start workflow called "Production Schedule Coordinator"

  - **Cast calendars**: Main actors, supporting cast, extras
  - **Crew calendars**: Director, DP, sound, makeup, wardrobe
  - **Equipment calendars**: Camera packages, lighting, vehicles
- Set up "Calendar Sync" to check availability in real-time

### 3. Detect Scheduling Conflicts Automatically
- Add "Conflict Detection" node to identify issues:
  - **Cast double-booked**: Actor needed for two scenes same day
  - **Location unavailable**: Booking conflicts or permit issues
  - **Equipment conflicts**: Camera package needed for multiple units
  - **Weather dependencies**: Outdoor scenes with bad weather forecast

### 4. Generate Daily Call Sheets
- Add "Call Sheet Generator" with professional template:
  - **Production info**: Title, date, location, weather forecast
  - **Cast call times**: Makeup, wardrobe, on-set times
  - **Crew call times**: Department-specific arrival times
  - **Scene breakdown**: Schedule, setup requirements, special notes
  - **Contact list**: Key personnel emergency contacts

### 5. Automate Distribution and Communication

  - **Email**: PDF call sheets to cast and crew
  - **SMS**: Critical time changes and weather alerts  
  - **Slack/WhatsApp**: Production team coordination
  - **App notifications**: Location changes and last-minute updates

### 6. Handle Schedule Changes and Updates
- Add "Change Management" workflow:
  - **Automatic rescheduling**: Suggest alternative dates for conflicts
  - **Cascade updates**: Notify affected departments of changes
  - **Version control**: Track all schedule revisions with timestamps
  - **Approval process**: Require producer approval for major changes

### 7. Location and Logistics Coordination
- Add "Location Management" integration:
  - **Permit tracking**: Ensure all permits are current and valid
  - **Address and directions**: Include GPS coordinates and parking info
  - **Special requirements**: Catering setup, bathroom facilities, power needs
  - **Contact information**: Location managers and emergency contacts
