**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can analyze script feedback and track development progress using any AI assistant. Perfect for indie projects or smaller productions.

**What an LLM can do:**
Analyze script feedback, compare drafts, and create development summaries to help guide your revision process.

**Simple Multi-Step Prompt:**

```
I'm tracking the development of a film script. Please help me analyze feedback and plan the next revision.

PROJECT DETAILS:
- Genre: [ACTION/DRAMA/COMEDY/etc.]
- Logline: [ONE-SENTENCE DESCRIPTION]
- Current draft: [VERSION NUMBER]
- Target length: [PAGES]

FEEDBACK TO ANALYZE:
[PASTE ALL READER FEEDBACK, NOTES, AND COMMENTS HERE]

Please provide:

1. FEEDBACK SUMMARY
   - Most common concerns or issues
   - Strongest positive feedback
   - Contradictory opinions to resolve

2. PRIORITY ISSUES
   - Critical problems that need immediate attention
   - Important improvements for next draft
   - Minor polish items for later

3. REVISION PLAN
   - Suggested order for addressing issues
   - Estimated impact of each change
   - What to focus on in next draft

4. STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION
   - Key points to discuss with director
   - Updates for financiers/executives
   - Timeline for next draft delivery

Make this actionable for a producer managing script development.
```

**JSON Template Option:**
```
Format as JSON for organized tracking:
{
  "current_draft": "v2.1",
  "feedback_summary": {
    "critical_issues": ["pacing in act 2", "unclear character motivation"],
    "positive_elements": ["strong dialogue", "compelling premise"],
    "contradictions": ["some love ending, others want darker tone"]
  },
  "revision_priorities": [
    {
      "issue": "Act 2 pacing",
      "priority": "high",
      "estimated_effort": "major rewrite",
      "target_pages": "45-75"
    }
  ],
  "next_steps": ["address pacing issues", "clarify character arcs", "polish dialogue"]
}
```

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically organize script files
- No automatic feedback collection from readers
- Can't track deadlines or send reminders
- No integration with script writing software

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- Managing multiple projects simultaneously
