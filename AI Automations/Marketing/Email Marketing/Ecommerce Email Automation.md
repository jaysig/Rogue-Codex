**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically trigger emails based on customer behavior
- No real-time cart tracking or behavioral segmentation
- Can't personalize content based on individual purchase data automatically
- No automated product recommendations or inventory integration

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You have regular online sales requiring systematic email follow-up
- You need real-time cart abandonment and behavioral triggers
- You want automated product recommendations and personalization
- You have complex customer lifecycles requiring sophisticated segmentation
