## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

### 1. Create Lead Nurturing Workflow
- Start workflow called "Lead Nurturing & Scoring Automation"
- Add "Webhook" node to capture new leads from various sources

### 2. Lead Scoring & Qualification
Add **"Code"** node for comprehensive scoring calculation:
- **Demographic scoring**: Company size, industry, job title, location
- **Behavioral scoring**: Email engagement, website activity, content downloads
- **Firmographic scoring**: Budget indicators, timeline signals, decision authority
- **Negative scoring**: Unsubscribes, low engagement, disqualifying factors

### 3. Progressive Profiling System
Use **"IF"** nodes to trigger strategic data collection:
- Send targeted surveys for missing demographic information
- Request additional details through gated content and resources
- Gather preferences and interests gradually through engagement
- Validate and enrich existing data with third-party sources

### 4. Nurture Sequence Management
Add **"Switch"** node for intelligent sequence routing:
- **Top-of-funnel**: Educational content, industry insights, awareness building
- **Middle-funnel**: Product-focused content, case studies, solution comparisons
- **Bottom-funnel**: Demo requests, trial offers, pricing information
- **Customer**: Onboarding sequences, expansion opportunities, loyalty programs

### 5. Sales Handoff Automation
Use **"IF"** node for qualification threshold management:
- Alert sales team when lead score reaches predefined threshold
- Create opportunities in CRM automatically with complete lead context
- Include lead source, engagement history, and behavioral data
- Set follow-up reminders and next action recommendations for sales team

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically score and nurture leads in real-time
- No automated progressive profiling or data collection
- Can't integrate with CRM and sales tools automatically
- Limited to planning rather than execution

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You have consistent lead flow requiring systematic nurturing
- You need real-time lead scoring and automated routing
- You want automatic sales handoff and CRM integration
- You have complex lead sources and qualification requirements
