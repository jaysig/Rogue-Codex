Please create behavioral email sequences for:

1. NEW SUBSCRIBER WELCOME SEQUENCE
   - Trigger: New email signup
   - Goal: Introduce brand and set expectations
   - Length: 5-7 emails over 2 weeks

My brand voice is: [PROFESSIONAL/CASUAL/FRIENDLY/etc.]
My main value propositions: [WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT]
```

**JSON Template Option:**
```
Format as JSON:
{
  "welcome_sequence": {
    "trigger": "new_signup",
    "emails": [
      {
        "day": 0,
        "subject": "Welcome to [Brand]! Here's what to expect",
        "content_theme": "brand introduction and expectations",
        "personalization": ["first_name", "signup_source"],
        "cta": "explore our most popular products"
      }
    ]
  },
  "cart_abandonment": {
    "trigger": "cart_abandoned_1_hour",
    "emails": [
      {
        "delay": "1 hour",
        "subject": "Forgot something? Your cart is waiting",
        "content_theme": "gentle reminder with product images",
        "personalization": ["cart_items", "total_value"],
        "cta": "complete your purchase"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically trigger emails based on behavior
- No real-time behavioral tracking and segmentation
- Can't personalize content based on individual data automatically
- No automated send time optimization

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You have regular email subscribers requiring behavioral targeting
- You need real-time triggers and automated personalization
- You want sophisticated behavioral tracking and segmentation
- You have complex customer journeys requiring multiple touchpoints

## üéØ Getting Started

### Start with Welcome Sequences
Begin with simple welcome email automation before moving to complex behavioral triggers and personalization.

### Use Your Current Platform
Connect behavioral tracking to whatever email platform you already use rather than switching tools.

### Define Key Behaviors
Identify the most important customer behaviors that indicate purchase intent or engagement.

### Test with Small Segments
Start with small subscriber segments to test behavioral triggers before scaling to your entire list.
