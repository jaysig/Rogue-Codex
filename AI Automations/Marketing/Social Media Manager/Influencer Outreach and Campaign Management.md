**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically discover and evaluate influencers
- No automated outreach or relationship management
- Can't track campaign performance or ROI automatically
- Limited to planning rather than execution of influencer partnerships

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You're running regular influencer campaigns requiring systematic management
- You need scalable outreach and relationship management capabilities
- You want automated performance tracking and ROI analysis
- You have growing influencer programs requiring streamlined processes
