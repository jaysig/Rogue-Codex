**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't monitor campaigns continuously or make real-time adjustments
- No automated bid management or budget optimization
- Can't run A/B tests or implement optimizations automatically
- Limited to current data analysis rather than ongoing optimization

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You're running multiple campaigns requiring constant optimization
- You need real-time bid management and budget adjustments
- You want continuous A/B testing and performance optimization
- You have complex campaigns across multiple platforms requiring coordination
