**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically score and route leads in real-time
- No automated nurture sequence execution
- Can't integrate with CRM and sales tools automatically
- Limited by how much lead data you can analyze at once

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You have regular lead flow requiring consistent management
- You need real-time lead scoring and automated routing
- You want automatic sales handoff and CRM integration
- You have multiple lead sources and complex nurturing requirements

## üéØ Getting Started

### Define Scoring Criteria
Establish clear lead scoring methodology based on your ideal customer profile and sales success data.

### Start with Simple Scoring
Begin with basic demographic and behavioral scoring before adding complex attribution and intent signals.

### Align Sales and Marketing
Ensure both teams agree on lead qualification criteria and handoff processes before automation.

### Test with Small Volume
Start with a subset of leads to refine scoring and nurturing before scaling to full lead volume.
