Format this as a campaign coordination brief for implementation.
```

**JSON Template Option:**
```
Format as JSON:
{
  "campaign_overview": {
    "name": "Q1 Product Launch",
    "objective": "drive 500 qualified leads",
    "budget": "$10,000",
    "duration": "4 weeks"
  },
  "channel_allocation": {
    "google_ads": {
      "budget": "$4,000 (40%)",
      "focus": "search campaigns for high-intent keywords",
      "timeline": "launch day 1, optimize weekly"
    },
    "facebook_ads": {
      "budget": "$3,000 (30%)",
      "focus": "awareness and retargeting campaigns",
      "timeline": "launch day 1, A/B test creatives"
    }
  },
  "coordination_timeline": [
    {
      "phase": "pre-launch",
      "timeline": "2 weeks before",
      "tasks": ["finalize creatives", "set up tracking", "test campaigns"]
    }
  ],
  "success_metrics": {
    "primary": "cost per qualified lead under $20",
    "secondary": "10% increase in brand awareness"
  }
}
```

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically execute campaigns across platforms
- No real-time budget monitoring and optimization
- Can't automatically adjust campaigns based on performance
- Limited to planning rather than execution automation

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You're running multiple campaigns simultaneously
- You need real-time budget optimization and reallocation
- You want automatic performance monitoring and adjustments
- You have complex cross-channel attribution requirements

## üéØ Getting Started

### Start with Two Channels
Begin coordinating between your two highest-performing channels before expanding to full multi-channel orchestration.

### Use Your Current Platforms
Connect automations to whatever marketing platforms you already use rather than switching tools for automation.

### Define Clear Objectives
Establish specific campaign objectives and KPIs that work across all channels before implementing coordination.

### Test with Small Budget
Start with smaller campaigns to test coordination workflows before scaling to larger budget allocations.
