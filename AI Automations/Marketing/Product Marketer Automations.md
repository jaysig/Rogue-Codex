## üì± Social Media Content Factory

**What It Does:** Creates and posts content across all your social media platforms automatically.

**How It Works:**
1. You write one basic idea or product update
2. AI creates different versions for each platform
3. Automatically posts at the best times
4. Tracks which posts perform well
5. Suggests improvements for next time

**What You Need:**
- Social media accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)
- n8n automation account
- AI writing tool (ChatGPT or similar)
- Content calendar template

**Step-by-Step n8n Setup:**

1. **Create New Workflow**
   - Go to n8n and click "New workflow"
   - Name it "Social Media Content Factory"

2. **Add Your Starting Point**
   - Add a "Manual Trigger" node (this lets you start the workflow when ready)
   - Or add a "Schedule Trigger" to post automatically every day

3. **Connect Social Media Accounts**
   - Add nodes for each platform you use:
     - "Twitter" node for X/Twitter posts
     - "LinkedIn" node for LinkedIn posts  
     - "Facebook" node for Facebook posts
   - Click each node and connect your accounts (n8n will walk you through this)

4. **Add AI Writing Helper**
   - Add an "OpenAI" node or "ChatGPT" node
   - Write a simple prompt like: "Turn this idea into a Twitter post: {{ $json.idea }}"
   - Copy this node for each platform with different prompts

5. **Set Up Content Input**
   - Add a "Set" node at the start
   - Create a field called "idea" where you type your content idea
   - This feeds into all your AI writing nodes

6. **Connect Everything Together**
   - Link the nodes with lines (drag from one dot to another)
   - Test by clicking "Execute workflow" with a sample idea

7. **Add Smart Timing**
   - Use "Schedule Trigger" set to post at your best times
   - Most businesses: 9 AM, 1 PM, 5 PM work well

**Alternative: Make.com Setup**

If you prefer Make.com instead of n8n:

1. **Create New Scenario**
   - Go to Make.com and click "Create a new scenario"
   - Name it "Social Media Content Factory"

2. **Add Trigger Module**
   - Add "Webhooks > Custom webhook" for manual triggering
   - Or use "Schedule" module for automatic posting

3. **Connect Social Platforms**
   - Add modules for each platform:
     - "Twitter > Create a Tweet"
     - "LinkedIn > Create a Share"
     - "Facebook > Create a Post"
   - Connect your accounts when prompted

4. **Add AI Content Creation**
   - Add "OpenAI > Create a Chat Completion"
   - Set prompt: "Turn this idea into a Twitter post: {{1.idea}}"
   - Duplicate for each platform with platform-specific prompts

5. **Set Up Data Flow**
   - Use "Set Variable" to capture your content idea
   - Route data through AI modules, then to social platforms
   - Test scenario with sample content

üí° **Make MCP Tip**: If using Claude Code, install the [Make MCP server](https://github.com/integromat/make-mcp-server) to build scenarios directly in your conversation.

**What You Get:**
- 5 different posts from 1 idea
- Consistent posting every day
- 80% less time writing posts
- Better engagement from timing

### ü§ñ LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can create social media content for all your platforms in a single conversation with any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.). This works great for one-off campaigns or when you're just getting started.

**What an LLM can do:**
Turn one content idea into posts for every platform you use, each written in the right style and length for that platform.

**Simple Multi-Step Prompt:**

```
I need to create social media posts for [CONTENT IDEA/ANNOUNCEMENT]. 

Please create posts for these platforms:
- LinkedIn (professional, 150-200 words)
- Twitter/X (engaging, under 280 characters) 
- Instagram (visual-focused with hashtags)
- Facebook (conversational, 100-150 words)

For each platform:
1. Match the tone to that platform's style
2. Include relevant hashtags
3. Suggest the best posting time
4. Add a call-to-action if appropriate

My brand voice is: [DESCRIBE YOUR STYLE: friendly/professional/casual/etc.]
My target audience is: [WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO]
```

**JSON Template Option:**
If you want organized output, add this to your prompt:

```
Please format the response as JSON like this:
{
  "linkedin": {
    "post": "content here",
    "hashtags": ["#hashtag1", "#hashtag2"],
    "best_time": "Tuesday 9 AM",
    "call_to_action": "suggested CTA"
  },
  "twitter": { ... },
  "instagram": { ... },
  "facebook": { ... }
}
```

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically post for you
- No scheduling or timing optimization
- Can't track what content performs best
- No automated posting consistency

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You're posting daily or multiple times per week
- You want automatic posting while you sleep
- You need performance tracking and optimization
- You have multiple content themes to rotate through
