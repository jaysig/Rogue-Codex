**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically collect feedback from multiple channels continuously
- No real-time sentiment monitoring or trend analysis
- Can't route feedback to appropriate teams automatically
- Limited to current feedback analysis rather than ongoing intelligence gathering

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You receive customer feedback regularly across multiple channels
- You need real-time sentiment monitoring and trend analysis
- You want automated feedback routing and stakeholder notifications
- You have complex customer segmentation requiring systematic feedback analysis
