## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

### 1. Create Lead Scoring Workflow
- Start workflow called "Lead Scoring & Qualification Engine"
- Add "Webhook" node to receive visitor and engagement data

### 2. Behavioral Data Collection
Add tracking nodes for comprehensive lead behavior monitoring:
- **Website activity**: Page visits, time spent, content downloads, pricing page views
- **Email engagement**: Opens, clicks, replies, and forward behavior
- **Social media interaction**: Profile visits, content engagement, connection requests
- **Content consumption**: Whitepaper downloads, webinar attendance, demo requests

### 3. Scoring Algorithm Implementation
Use **"Code"** node to calculate lead scores based on weighted criteria:
- **Demographic scoring**: Company size, industry, job title, location (5-25 points each)
- **Behavioral scoring**: Website visits (5 points), email opens (10 points), content downloads (20 points)
- **Intent scoring**: Pricing page visits (30 points), demo requests (50 points), contact form submissions (75 points)
- **Negative scoring**: Unsubscribes (-20 points), bounced emails (-10 points), competitor employment (-50 points)

### 4. Lead Qualification and Routing
Use **"Switch"** node to categorize leads by score and readiness:
- **Hot leads (75+ points)**: Immediate sales handoff with priority treatment
- **Warm leads (40-74 points)**: Marketing nurture sequence with sales awareness
- **Cold leads (10-39 points)**: Educational content and long-term nurturing
- **Unqualified leads (<10 points)**: Remove from active follow-up or re-engage campaigns

### 5. Sales Alert and Handoff System
Add notification nodes for timely sales engagement:
- **Instant alerts** for hot leads with score breakdown and recent activity
- **Daily summary reports** of warm leads and their engagement patterns
- **CRM integration** to automatically create opportunities and tasks
- **Lead context provision** including score history, engagement timeline, and recommended approach

## Alternative: Make.com Setup

### 1. Create Lead Scoring Scenario
- Name scenario "Lead Scoring & Qualification Engine"

### 2. Score Calculation and Analysis
- Add "Math > Calculate score" based on behavioral and demographic data
- Use "Data > Analyze patterns" for engagement quality assessment
- Include "AI > Evaluate readiness" for buying signal identification

### 3. Qualification and Routing
- Add "CRM > Update lead status" based on score thresholds
- Use "Sales > Create task" for qualified leads requiring follow-up
- Include "Marketing > Add to sequence" for leads needing further nurturing

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically track and score leads in real-time
- No automated CRM integration or sales alerts
- Can't optimize scoring based on actual sales outcomes
- Limited to planning rather than execution

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You have consistent lead flow requiring systematic scoring
- You need real-time lead alerts and CRM integration
- You want automated optimization based on sales results
- You have complex lead sources requiring comprehensive tracking
