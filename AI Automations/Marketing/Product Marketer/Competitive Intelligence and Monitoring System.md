**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't monitor competitors automatically or detect changes in real-time
- No automated alerts for competitive moves or market developments
- Can't track trends and patterns over time automatically
- Limited to current analysis rather than ongoing competitive intelligence

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You're in a rapidly changing competitive market requiring constant monitoring
- You need real-time alerts for competitive threats and opportunities
- You want systematic tracking of multiple competitors across various channels
- You have competitive strategy that depends on timely market intelligence
