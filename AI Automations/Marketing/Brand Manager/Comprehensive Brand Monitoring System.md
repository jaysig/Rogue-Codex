## ü§ñ LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can analyze brand mentions and get insights in a single conversation with any AI assistant. Perfect for periodic brand audits or when reviewing specific time periods.

**Simple Multi-Step Prompt:**

```
I need to analyze brand mentions and understand what people are saying about my brand.

Here are brand mentions I've collected:
[PASTE YOUR BRAND MENTIONS - social media posts, reviews, news articles, forum discussions, etc.]

Please analyze these mentions and provide:

1. SENTIMENT BREAKDOWN
   - What percentage is positive/negative/neutral
   - Overall brand sentiment and mood
   - Key emotional themes in feedback

2. MENTION CATEGORIZATION
   - Group by source type (social, news, reviews, forums)
   - Identify high-influence vs. general mentions
   - Flag any urgent or crisis-related mentions

3. KEY THEMES & INSIGHTS
   - Most common topics being discussed
   - Brand strengths highlighted by customers
   - Areas of concern or criticism
   - Trending conversations or topics

4. COMPETITIVE CONTEXT
   - How brand mentions compare to competitors
   - Share of voice analysis if competitor data available
   - Unique positioning or differentiation mentioned

5. ACTION PRIORITIES
   - Urgent mentions requiring immediate response
   - Positive mentions to amplify or leverage
   - Issues needing brand team attention
   - Opportunities for engagement or improvement

Format this as a brand monitoring report for a brand manager.

My brand: [YOUR BRAND NAME]
My industry: [YOUR INDUSTRY]
My key competitors: [COMPETITOR NAMES]
```

**JSON Template Option:**
```
Format as JSON:
{
  "sentiment_summary": {
    "positive": "65%",
    "negative": "20%",
    "neutral": "15%",
    "overall_mood": "generally positive"
  },
  "urgent_alerts": [
    {
      "mention": "customer complaint about product defect",
      "source": "Twitter",
      "priority": "high",
      "recommended_action": "immediate customer service response"
    }
  ],
  "key_themes": [
    {
      "theme": "product quality",
      "frequency": "mentioned 25 times",
      "sentiment": "mostly positive",
      "insight": "customers love durability but want more color options"
    }
  ],
  "amplification_opportunities": [
    "customer success story on LinkedIn with 500+ likes"
  ]
}
```

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't monitor mentions automatically
- No real-time alerts for urgent issues
- Can't track trends over time
- Limited by how much text you can analyze at once

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You need real-time brand monitoring
- You want automatic alerts for negative mentions
- You have high mention volume requiring constant monitoring
- You need historical trend analysis and reporting
