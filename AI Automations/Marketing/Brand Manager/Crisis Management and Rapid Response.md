Current brand context:
- Company: [YOUR COMPANY NAME]

**JSON Template Option:**
```
Format as JSON:
{
  "crisis_assessment": {
    "severity": "medium",
    "impact_score": "6/10",
    "escalation_risk": "moderate",
    "response_urgency": "24 hours"
  },
  "immediate_actions": [
    {
      "priority": "1",
      "action": "issue public statement acknowledging concern",
      "timeline": "within 2 hours",
      "owner": "PR team"
    }
  ],
  "key_messages": {
    "customers": "We take this seriously and are investigating immediately",
    "employees": "Internal communication about our response plan",
    "media": "Transparent acknowledgment with commitment to resolution"
  },
  "monitoring_plan": {
    "metrics": ["sentiment tracking", "mention volume", "news coverage"],
    "escalation_triggers": ["viral social media spread", "major media pickup"]
  }
}
```

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't monitor for crises automatically
- No real-time alerts or escalation
- Can't coordinate team response automatically
- Limited to current situation analysis

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You need 24/7 crisis monitoring and early detection
- You want automatic escalation to crisis teams
- You need coordinated response across multiple channels
- You have complex stakeholder communication requirements
