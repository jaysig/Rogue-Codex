Please analyze this content and provide:

   - Areas of strong alignment
   - Areas needing improvement

**JSON Template Option:**
```
Format as JSON:
{
  "compliance_score": {
    "overall": "8/10",
    "voice_tone": "9/10",
    "messaging": "7/10",
    "guidelines": "8/10"
  },
  "analysis": {
    "strengths": ["consistent voice", "good value alignment"],
    "weaknesses": ["inconsistent terminology", "off-brand tone in piece 3"]
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "priority": "high",
      "issue": "inconsistent product naming",
      "suggestion": "use 'ProductName Pro' not 'Product Pro'",
      "content_location": "social media post 2"
    }
  ],

}
```

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically monitor all brand content
- No real-time alerts for brand violations
- Can't enforce guidelines across teams automatically
- Limited by how much content you can review at once

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You have multiple teams creating brand content regularly
- You need real-time brand monitoring across all channels
- You want automatic guideline enforcement and approval workflows
- You have high-volume content creation requiring consistent monitoring
