**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically execute and monitor experiments continuously
- No real-time statistical significance tracking or automated results analysis
- Can't implement winning experiments or scale tactics automatically
- Limited to planning and analysis rather than execution

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You're running multiple growth experiments simultaneously across various channels
- You need real-time experiment monitoring and statistical analysis
- You want automated scaling of winning tactics and systematic optimization
- You have complex growth strategy requiring comprehensive experimentation management
