## LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can research any company thoroughly in a single conversation with an AI assistant. Perfect for preparing for specific interviews or applications without setting up automation.

**What an LLM can do:**
Create a complete company research report with recent news, culture insights, key people, and interview talking points.

**Simple Multi-Step Prompt:**

```
I'm interviewing with [COMPANY NAME] for a [JOB TITLE] position. Please help me research this company.

Create a research report with these sections:

1. COMPANY OVERVIEW
   - What they do in simple terms
   - How they make money
   - Size and growth stage

2. RECENT NEWS (last 6 months)
   - Major announcements
   - Product launches
   - Leadership changes
   - Industry recognition

3. COMPANY CULTURE
   - Work environment and values
   - Employee reviews highlights
   - Remote work policies
   - Growth opportunities

4. KEY PEOPLE TO KNOW
   - CEO and leadership team
   - People in my target department
   - Anyone I might interview with

5. CONVERSATION STARTERS
   - Recent achievements to mention
   - Industry trends they're part of
   - Questions about their strategy
   - Smart questions about the role

6. POTENTIAL RED FLAGS
   - Recent negative news
   - Employee concerns
   - Financial challenges
   - Cultural issues to be aware of

Please format this as an easy-to-review document I can study before my interview.
```

**JSON Template Option:**
For organized notes, add this to your prompt:

```
Please format the key information as JSON:
{
  "company_snapshot": {
    "business_model": "...",
    "revenue": "...",
    "employee_count": "...",
    "recent_valuation": "..."
  },
  "recent_news": [
    {
      "headline": "...",
      "date": "...",
      "impact": "..."
    }
  ],
  "interview_talking_points": [
    "Point about recent growth...",
    "Question about their AI strategy..."
  ],
  "red_flags": ["Any concerns to be aware of..."]
}
```

**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically update with new information
- No ongoing monitoring of company changes
- Can't set up alerts for new developments
- Limited to publicly available information

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You're job searching actively and researching 10+ companies
- You want ongoing updates about target companies
- You need alerts when dream companies have new openings
- You're in a long job search spanning several months
