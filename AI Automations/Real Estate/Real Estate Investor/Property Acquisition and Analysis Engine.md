## Key Investment Calculations Made Simple

**Cash Flow Analysis:**
- Monthly rent income
- Minus mortgage payment
- Minus property taxes
- Minus insurance
- Minus maintenance allowance (5-10% of rent)
- Minus vacancy allowance (5-8% of rent)
- Minus property management (8-12% if using)
- = Net monthly cash flow

**Return on Investment:**
- Annual cash flow √∑ total cash invested = Cash-on-cash return
- Net operating income √∑ purchase price = Cap rate
- Include appreciation for total return potential

**Deal Quality Indicators:**
- Positive cash flow from day one
- Cap rate above market average for the area
- Cash-on-cash return above your minimum requirement
- Property in stable or growing neighborhood
- Realistic rent assumptions based on comparables

## Pro Tips for Better Deal Analysis

**Setting Realistic Expectations:**
- Use conservative rent estimates (don't assume best-case scenario)
- Factor in 1-2 months vacancy per year
- Budget for maintenance and repairs (older properties need more)
- Consider property management costs even if you'll manage yourself initially
- Include capital improvements needed in first year

**Market Research Made Easy:**
- Look at recent sales of similar properties
- Check actual rents on similar units (not asking rents)
- Research neighborhood trends and development plans
- Consider crime rates and school quality
- Factor in economic drivers (major employers, job growth)

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- Properties priced well below market (usually means problems)
- Areas with declining population or employment
- Properties with recent major repairs needed
- Unrealistic rent assumptions by sellers
- Markets you don't understand well

## Common Questions

**Q: How accurate are these automated analyses?**
A: Very accurate for initial screening, but you should always verify key assumptions (rents, expenses, condition) before making offers.

**Q: Can this replace my local market knowledge?**
A: No, it enhances your knowledge by doing the math quickly. Your local expertise is still crucial for final decisions.

**Q: What if I invest in different property types?**
A: Set up different analysis rules for apartments, single-family rentals, commercial properties, etc. Each has different criteria.

**Q: How do I know my criteria are right?**
A: Start conservative and adjust based on deals you actually find profitable. The system learns what works in your markets.
