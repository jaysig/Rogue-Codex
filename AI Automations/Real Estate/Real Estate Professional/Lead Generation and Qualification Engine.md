# Lead Generation & Qualification Engine

**What It Does:** Automatically finds and sorts new potential clients from websites, emails, and social media, then tells you which ones are most likely to buy or sell a house.

**How It Helps You:** Instead of spending hours checking every lead manually, this system does it for you and only shows you the best ones. Like having an assistant who never sleeps.

**Perfect For:** Real estate agents, brokers, new agents who get lots of leads, busy agents who miss opportunities

## How It Works (Simple Steps)

1. **Watches for New Leads** - Automatically collects people who fill out forms on your website, Zillow, Facebook, etc.
2. **Sorts the Good from the Bad** - Uses AI to look at what people write and decide who's serious about buying/selling
3. **Gives Each Lead a Score** - Rates leads from 1-10 based on how likely they are to actually buy or sell
4. **Sends You the Best Ones First** - High-scoring leads get sent to you immediately, others go into follow-up sequences
5. **Starts Conversations Automatically** - Sends personalized emails and texts based on what each person is looking for

## What You Need to Get Started

**Basic Requirements:**
- A CRM system (like Top Producer, BoomTown, or Follow Up Boss)
- Access to lead sources (your website, Zillow Pro, Facebook ads)

A: You can adjust the scoring rules anytime, and it learns from your feedback. Start conservative and refine based on results.

**Q: Do I need to be technical to set this up?**
A: Not at all. Both platforms use visual, drag-and-drop interfaces. Most agents set it up in a weekend.

**Q: What if I already have a CRM I like?**
