# Client Relationship Management System

**What It Does:** Automatically keeps in touch with past and current clients by sending birthday wishes, anniversary notes, market updates, and helpful tips at just the right times.

**How It Helps You:** Instead of forgetting to follow up or manually tracking when to contact people, this system remembers everything and keeps you top-of-mind with clients. Like having a personal assistant who never forgets an important date.

**Perfect For:** Agents who want referrals, agents with many past clients, busy agents who forget to follow up, agents building long-term relationships

## How It Works (Simple Steps)

1. **Remembers Important Dates** - Tracks closing anniversaries, birthdays, and other special occasions
2. **Sends Personal Messages** - Creates customized emails and texts based on each client's situation
3. **Shares Market Updates** - Sends neighborhood reports and home value updates for their specific area
4. **Asks for Referrals** - Requests referrals and reviews at the perfect timing (not too soon, not too late)
5. **Provides Value** - Shares home maintenance tips, local events, and helpful resources

A: Not if you're providing value! Focus on helpful information and genuine care, not sales pitches. Most clients appreciate staying connected.

**Q: How often should I contact past clients?**
A: Start with quarterly market updates and annual anniversary messages. You can increase frequency if they respond positively.

**Q: What if I don't have birthdays or personal info for all my clients?**
A: That's fine! Focus on closing anniversaries and market updates. You can gradually collect more personal information over time.

**Q: Should I personalize every message?**
A: The automation handles basic personalization (names, addresses, dates). You can add personal touches to important clients manually.
