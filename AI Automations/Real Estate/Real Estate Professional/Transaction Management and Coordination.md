# Transaction Management & Coordination

**What It Does:** Automatically keeps track of all the deadlines and tasks from contract to closing, sends reminders to everyone involved, and makes sure nothing falls through the cracks.

**How It Helps You:** Instead of manually tracking inspection dates, loan deadlines, and paperwork, this system remembers everything and keeps everyone on schedule. Like having a transaction coordinator who never takes a day off.

**Perfect For:** Busy agents with multiple transactions, new agents who don't want to miss deadlines, agents who want to look super organized

## How It Works (Simple Steps)

1. **Creates Complete Timeline** - When you get a signed contract, it automatically calculates all important dates
2. **Tracks Everyone's Tasks** - Monitors what the buyer, seller, lender, inspector, and attorney need to do
3. **Sends Automatic Reminders** - Texts and emails everyone before deadlines
4. **Updates Status** - Shows you exactly where each transaction stands
5. **Alerts for Problems** - Warns you if something might cause delays
