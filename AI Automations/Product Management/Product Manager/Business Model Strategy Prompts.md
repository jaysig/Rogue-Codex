## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get business model analysis without any automation setup. Just use a simple conversation with an advanced AI model:

### Quick Prompt Template

Copy and paste this prompt, filling in your specific information:

```
I need help analyzing potential business models for my app idea. Here's my Product Requirements Document:

[PASTE YOUR PRD HERE]

Optional context:
- Company goals: [e.g., "rapid user acquisition", "profitability in 2 years"]
- Known constraints: [e.g., "small development team", "limited funding"]

Please act as an expert business model strategist and:

1. Summarize the core problem, target audience, and value proposition
2. Suggest 5+ different business model options (freemium, subscription, marketplace, etc.)
3. For each model, explain:
   - How it would work for this specific app
   - 2-3 pros and cons
   - Key feature needed to make it work
4. Recommend the 1-2 best options with clear reasoning
5. Ask me 3-4 critical questions to help validate the recommendation

Structure your response with clear headings and be specific about how each model relates to my PRD details.
```

### JSON Template for Structured Output

If you want more organized results, add this to your prompt:

```
Please format your final recommendations as JSON:

{
  "core_analysis": {
    "problem": "...",
    "audience": "...",
    "value_prop": "..."
  },
  "top_models": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "description": "...",
      "pros": ["...", "..."],
      "cons": ["...", "..."],
      "key_feature": "..."
    }
  ],
  "recommendation": "...",
  "critical_questions": ["...", "...", "..."]
}
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach

- **One-time analysis**: No systematic tracking of business model evolution
- **Manual updates**: Need to re-run analysis when PRD changes
- **No integration**: Results aren't connected to product development tools
- **Limited templates**: Each analysis starts from scratch

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you're regularly evaluating multiple product ideas, need to track business model evolution over time, or want to integrate business model analysis with your product development workflow.
