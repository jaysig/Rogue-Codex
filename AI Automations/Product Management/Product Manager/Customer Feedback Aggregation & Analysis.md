**What It Does:** Systematically aggregates customer feedback from multiple touchpoints, uses AI to categorize and analyze patterns, and generates actionable insights for product decision-making.

**How It Works:**
1. Collects feedback from support tickets, app store reviews, social media, surveys, and sales calls
2. Uses AI to categorize feedback by feature area, sentiment, and urgency level
3. Identifies trending issues and feature requests across customer segments
4. Generates prioritized product insights with customer impact scoring
5. Creates automated reports and alerts for product teams and stakeholders

**What You Need:**
- Customer support system (Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk)

## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

### 1. Create Feedback Aggregation Workflow
- Start new workflow called "Customer Feedback Aggregation & Analysis"
- Add multiple triggers for different feedback sources

### 2. Multi-Channel Feedback Collection
- Add "HTTP Request" nodes for various feedback sources:
  - **Support tickets**: Connect to Zendesk/Intercom API for ticket content and customer data
  - **App store reviews**: Monitor iOS App Store and Google Play Store reviews
  - **Social media**: Track mentions, comments, and reviews on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn
  - **Survey responses**: Collect responses from customer satisfaction and product feedback surveys
  - **Sales feedback**: Integrate with CRM to capture customer feedback from sales conversations

### 3. AI-Powered Feedback Categorization
- Use "OpenAI" node to analyze and categorize feedback:
  ```
  Analyze this customer feedback and provide structured categorization:
  
  FEEDBACK: [customer feedback content]
  CUSTOMER_SEGMENT: [if available]
  
  Provide analysis:
  - CATEGORY: Feature Request/Bug Report/User Experience/Performance/Integration/Other
  - FEATURE_AREA: [specific product area or feature]
  - SENTIMENT: Very Positive/Positive/Neutral/Negative/Very Negative
  - URGENCY: Low/Medium/High/Critical
  - IMPACT_SCOPE: Individual/Small Group/Large Segment/All Users
  - KEY_THEMES: [list of main themes or issues]
  - ACTIONABLE_INSIGHTS: [specific product improvements or actions]
  ```

### 4. Trend Analysis and Pattern Recognition
- Add "Function" nodes to identify patterns across feedback:
  - Group similar feedback by feature area and customer segment
  - Track sentiment trends over time by product area
  - Identify frequently requested features with customer impact scoring
  - Detect emerging issues before they become widespread problems

### 5. Prioritization and Impact Scoring
- Create automated scoring system for feedback prioritization:
  - Weight feedback by customer segment value and subscription tier
  - Score feature requests by frequency and potential customer impact
  - Prioritize bug reports by affected user count and business impact
  - Generate priority rankings for product roadmap planning

### 6. Automated Reporting and Alerts
- Add "Email" and "Slack" nodes for stakeholder communication:
  - Generate weekly product insights reports with trending feedback
  - Send immediate alerts for critical issues affecting multiple customers
  - Create monthly customer voice summaries for executive team
  - Update product management tools with categorized feedback and priorities
