# Developer Community Health Monitoring

Proactively monitors developer community health across forums, GitHub, and support channels with intelligent issue routing and sentiment analysis.

## What This Does

**What It Does:** Continuously monitors developer community health across multiple channels, automatically categorizes and routes issues, and provides real-time insights into developer sentiment and community engagement.

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors Discord, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and support channels for developer activity
2. Uses AI to categorize issues by complexity and urgency level
3. Automatically routes simple questions to documentation or self-service resources
4. Escalates complex technical issues to appropriate engineering teams
5. Tracks community sentiment and generates health reports for product teams

**What You Need:**
- Community platform APIs (Discord, Slack, GitHub)
- AI text analysis service (OpenAI, Claude, or similar)
- Issue tracking system (Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues)
- Analytics dashboard platform (Notion, Airtable, custom dashboard)
- Alert system (Slack, Teams, email)

## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

### 1. Create Community Monitoring Workflow
- Start new workflow called "Developer Community Health Monitoring"
- Add "Schedule Trigger" for hourly monitoring and "Webhook" for real-time events

### 2. Multi-Channel Data Collection
- Add "HTTP Request" nodes for different community platforms:
  - Discord API for server messages and reactions
  - GitHub API for issues, discussions, and pull request comments
  - Stack Overflow API for tagged questions and community discussions
  - Support system API for ticket creation and status updates

### 3. AI-Powered Issue Categorization
- Use "OpenAI" node to analyze and categorize community content:
  ```
  Analyze this developer community message and categorize it:
  
  MESSAGE: [community message content]
  
  Provide categorization:
  - COMPLEXITY: Simple/Medium/Complex
  - TYPE: Question/Bug Report/Feature Request/Discussion
  - URGENCY: Low/Medium/High/Critical
  - SENTIMENT: Positive/Neutral/Negative/Frustrated
  - TOPIC: [main technical topic]
  - SUGGESTED_ACTION: [auto-respond/route-to-team/escalate]
  ```

### 4. Intelligent Issue Routing
- Add "IF" nodes for automated routing based on categorization:
  - **Simple questions**: Auto-respond with documentation links
  - **Medium complexity**: Route to developer relations team
  - **Complex issues**: Escalate to appropriate engineering team
  - **Critical bugs**: Immediate alert to on-call engineering

### 5. Sentiment Analysis and Community Health Tracking
- Add "Function" nodes to track community metrics:
  - Overall sentiment trends by time period
  - Response time tracking by issue type and complexity
  - Community engagement metrics (participation, resolution rates)
  - Identification of frequent issues and documentation gaps

### 6. Automated Response and Alerts
- Add "Email" and "Slack" nodes for responses and notifications:
  - Send helpful documentation for simple questions
  - Alert teams when sentiment drops significantly
  - Notify product managers of trending issues
  - Generate weekly community health reports
