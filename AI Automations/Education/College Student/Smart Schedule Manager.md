## Common Questions

A: The system can detect changes if you re-upload updated syllabi, but always check with professors directly for changes.

**Q: Can this work with my school's learning management system?**
A: Basic integration works through email notifications and calendar exports. Full LMS integration requires more setup.

**Q: Will this help me study better?**
A: It helps you stay organized and never miss deadlines, but you still need to do the actual studying during blocked time.

**Q: What if I don't want to share my calendar data?**
A: Use a separate school-only Google account, or set up local calendar systems that don't sync to cloud services.
