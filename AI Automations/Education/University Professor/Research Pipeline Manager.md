- Use "arXiv API" for preprints in relevant fields
- Filter by keywords, authors, and impact factor thresholds

### 3. Literature Organization and Analysis
- Add "Zotero API" integration to save relevant papers automatically
- Use "OpenAI" node for abstract analysis:
  ```
  Analyze this research abstract and provide:
  - Main research question and methodology
  - Key findings and implications
  - Relevance to [Your Research Area]
  - Potential gaps or future research directions
  - Quality assessment and credibility indicators
  ```

### 4. Research Project Management
- Add "Project Tracker" with multiple research streams:
  - Literature collection phase
  - Data collection/analysis phase
  - Writing and revision phase
  - Submission and review phase
- Set milestone deadlines and progress tracking

### 5. Manuscript Submission Tracking
- Add "Journal Database" with submission requirements and timelines
- Track manuscript versions and revision deadlines
- Set reminders for reviewer responses and editorial decisions
- Manage resubmission workflows for different journals

### 6. Collaboration Management
- Add "Email Automation" for co-author coordination
- Share relevant literature automatically with research team
- Track contribution deadlines and manuscript sections
- Manage version control and document sharing

### 7. Publication Analytics
- Add "Citation Tracking" for published work
- Monitor research impact and citation networks
- Track conference presentation opportunities
- Generate research productivity reports
