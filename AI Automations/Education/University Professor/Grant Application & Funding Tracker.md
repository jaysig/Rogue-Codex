## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

### 1. Create Grant Management Workflow
- Start new workflow called "Grant Application & Funding Tracker"
- Add "Schedule Trigger" to run weekly for opportunity discovery

### 2. Funding Opportunity Discovery
- Add "NSF API" integration for federal funding opportunities
- Set up "NIH Reporter" searches for relevant programs
- Use "Foundation Directory" web scraping for private funding
- Filter opportunities by:
  - Research area and keywords
  - Funding amount range
  - Deadline timelines
  - Eligibility requirements

### 3. Opportunity Analysis and Scoring
- Add "OpenAI" node for opportunity assessment:
  ```
  Analyze this funding opportunity for relevance:
  - Research area alignment with [Your Research Focus]
  - Funding amount and duration suitability
  - Competition level and success rate
  - Application requirements and complexity
  - Strategic value for research program
  Provide recommendation score (1-10) and rationale.
  ```

### 4. Application Timeline Management
- Add "Project Management" node with grant application phases:
  - Pre-application research (4-6 weeks before)
  - Collaboration and team building (3-4 weeks before)
  - Application writing and development (2-3 weeks)
  - Review and submission (1 week before deadline)
- Set automated reminders for each phase

### 5. Collaboration Coordination
- Add "Team Management" for multi-investigator grants:
  - Co-investigator recruitment and coordination
  - Institution agreement and approval tracking
  - Budget development and justification
  - Document sharing and version control

### 6. Submission and Status Tracking
- Add "Application Tracker" with status monitoring:
  - Submission confirmation and receipt
  - Review timeline and decision dates
  - Reviewer feedback and scoring (when available)
  - Award notification and contract negotiation

### 7. Portfolio Management and Analytics
- Add "Funding Analytics" dashboard:
  - Success rate by funding agency and program
  - Application effort vs. award probability
  - Total funding pipeline and projections
  - Research area funding trends and opportunities
