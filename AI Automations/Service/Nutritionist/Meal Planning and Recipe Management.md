## Common Questions

**Q: Will automated meal plans be as good as custom-designed menus?**
A: Yes! The automation uses nutritional science principles and vast recipe databases to create more varied, nutritionally optimal meal plans than most practitioners have time to design manually.

**Q: How do we handle food allergies and complex dietary restrictions?**
A: The automation can incorporate multiple dietary restrictions simultaneously (gluten-free, dairy-free, low-sodium, etc.) and suggest appropriate substitutions while maintaining nutritional balance.

**Q: What if clients don't like certain foods or want to swap recipes?**
A: The system can learn client preferences over time and automatically avoid disliked foods while suggesting preferred alternatives that meet the same nutritional requirements.

**Q: Can this work for specialized diets (keto, Mediterranean, plant-based, etc.)?**
A: Absolutely! The automation can be programmed for any dietary approach with appropriate recipe databases and nutritional parameters for each eating style.
