# Knowledge Base Auto-Update System

**What It Does:** Automatically maintains and updates IT documentation, creates knowledge base articles from support tickets, and ensures technical documentation stays current with system changes and resolved issues.

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors resolved support tickets and extracts solution documentation
2. Automatically creates and updates knowledge base articles from common issues
3. Scans system changes and software updates to identify documentation needs
4. Reviews existing documentation for accuracy and suggests updates
5. Tracks documentation usage and identifies gaps in knowledge coverage

**What You Need:**
- Help desk system with ticket resolution data (ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk)
- Knowledge base platform (Confluence, SharePoint, Notion, IT Glue)
- System monitoring tools for change detection
- AI text processing capabilities for content generation

**Step-by-Step n8n Setup:**

1. **Create Knowledge Base Workflow**
   - Start workflow called "Knowledge Base Auto-Update System"
   - Add triggers for ticket resolution, system changes, and scheduled documentation reviews

2. **Ticket Analysis & Content Extraction**
   - Add "HTTP Request" node to fetch resolved tickets from help desk system
   - Use "OpenAI" node to analyze ticket data:
     - Extract problem description and resolution steps
     - Identify if issue is common enough to warrant documentation
     - Generate clear, step-by-step solution documentation
     - Suggest appropriate categories and tags for knowledge base

3. **Documentation Generation & Updates**
   - Query existing knowledge base for similar articles
   - Use "Switch" node to determine if new article needed or update existing
   - Generate new articles with standardized format:
     - Problem description and symptoms
     - Step-by-step resolution process
     - Required tools and permissions
     - Related articles and troubleshooting tips

4. **System Change Documentation**
   - Monitor system logs and change management systems
   - Identify changes that require documentation updates:
     - Software version updates and new features
     - Network configuration changes
     - Security policy updates
     - New hardware or system deployments
   - Generate update notifications for affected documentation

5. **Documentation Quality & Usage Tracking**
   - Track knowledge base article views and feedback ratings
   - Identify frequently accessed but poorly rated articles for improvement
   - Monitor search queries that return no results to identify content gaps
   - Generate monthly reports on documentation effectiveness and coverage

**Alternative: Make.com Setup**

1. **Create IT Documentation Scenario**
   - Name scenario "Knowledge Base Auto-Update System"
   - Add "Schedule > Run at specified times" for regular documentation maintenance

2. **Ticket Processing Pipeline**
   - Add help desk connector (ServiceNow, Jira Service Management, etc.)
   - Use "OpenAI > Create a chat completion" for solution extraction
   - Include "Filter" to identify tickets suitable for documentation

3. **Knowledge Base Integration**
   - Add knowledge base connector (Confluence, Notion, etc.)
   - Use "Search" modules to find existing related articles
   - Include "Create/Update" modules for documentation management

4. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Add "Google Analytics > Get reports" for usage tracking
   - Use "Data transformer" for documentation metrics analysis
   - Include "Slack > Create a message" for team notifications

ðŸ’¡ **Make MCP Tip**: Use the [Make MCP server](https://github.com/integromat/make-mcp-server) with Claude Code to build documentation scenarios with pre-built IT service management connectors.

**What You Get:**
- Eliminate 4-6 hours/week of manual documentation maintenance
- Increase knowledge base coverage by 80% through automated content creation
- Improve first-call resolution rates by 40% with better documentation
- Ensure documentation stays current with automated system change tracking
- Reduce duplicate tickets by 60% through comprehensive self-service documentation
