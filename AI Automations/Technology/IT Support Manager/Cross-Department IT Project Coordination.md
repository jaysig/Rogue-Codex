# Cross-Department IT Project Coordination

**What It Does:** Automatically coordinates IT projects across multiple departments, manages stakeholder communications, tracks project dependencies, and ensures smooth technology implementations with minimal business disruption.

**How It Works:**
1. Centralizes IT project planning and automatically identifies cross-department impacts
2. Coordinates project timelines with department schedules and business requirements
3. Manages stakeholder communications with automated updates and change notifications
4. Tracks project dependencies and resource requirements across departments
5. Monitors project progress and automatically escalates issues or delays to management

**What You Need:**
- Project management platform (Jira, Asana, Microsoft Project, Monday.com)
- Communication tools (Slack, Microsoft Teams, email systems)
- Resource scheduling and calendar systems
- IT asset and resource management tools

**Step-by-Step n8n Setup:**

1. **Create Project Coordination Workflow**
   - Start workflow called "Cross-Department IT Project Coordination"
   - Add triggers for new IT projects, milestone updates, and stakeholder requests

2. **Project Impact Analysis**
   - Add "OpenAI" node to analyze IT project requirements:
     - Identify departments affected by technology changes
     - Assess business process impacts and required training
     - Determine resource requirements and timeline dependencies
     - Generate stakeholder communication plans and schedules

3. **Stakeholder Coordination**
   - Use "HTTP Request" nodes to query department calendars and availability
   - Automatically schedule:
     - Project kickoff meetings with all affected departments
     - Training sessions for new technology implementations
     - Go-live coordination meetings and support coverage
     - Post-implementation review sessions and feedback collection

4. **Progress Tracking & Communications**
   - Monitor project management system for milestone completion
   - Send automated status updates to department stakeholders:
     - Weekly progress reports with upcoming milestones
     - Change notifications for scope or timeline adjustments
     - Issue alerts for delays or resource conflicts
     - Go-live preparation checklists and readiness assessments

5. **Resource & Dependency Management**
   - Track IT resource allocation across multiple projects
   - Monitor department availability for project activities
   - Identify and flag resource conflicts or scheduling issues
   - Coordinate vendor management and external resource scheduling

**Alternative: Make.com Setup**

1. **Create IT Project Scenario**
   - Name scenario "Cross-Department IT Project Coordination"
   - Add project management system webhooks for project updates

2. **Impact Assessment Pipeline**
   - Add "OpenAI > Create a chat completion" for project impact analysis
   - Use "Calendar > List events" to check department availability
   - Include "Filter" modules for different project types and urgency levels

3. **Communication Automation**
   - Add modules for each communication channel:
     - "Slack > Create a message" for team notifications
     - "Email > Send an email" for formal project communications
     - "Microsoft Teams > Post a message" for department updates

4. **Project Tracking & Reporting**
   - Add "Project Management > Get project" for status monitoring
   - Use "Data transformer" for progress calculations and reporting
   - Include "Google Sheets > Add a row" for project tracking logs
