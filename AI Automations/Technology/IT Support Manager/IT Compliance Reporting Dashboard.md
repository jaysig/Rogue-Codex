# IT Compliance Reporting Dashboard

**What It Does:** Automatically generates IT compliance reports, monitors regulatory requirements, tracks security audits, and maintains documentation for IT governance and risk management compliance.

**How It Works:**
1. Continuously monitors IT infrastructure for compliance with security and regulatory standards
2. Automatically generates compliance reports for audits and regulatory requirements
3. Tracks security patches, system updates, and configuration changes for compliance documentation
4. Monitors access controls, data handling, and privacy compliance across IT systems
5. Creates audit trails and compliance dashboards for management and regulatory review

**What You Need:**
- IT infrastructure monitoring tools (SIEM, system monitoring, network tools)
- Security management platforms (vulnerability scanners, patch management)
- Compliance frameworks knowledge (SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR, etc.)
- Reporting and dashboard platforms (Power BI, Tableau, Grafana)

**Step-by-Step n8n Setup:**

1. **Create Compliance Monitoring Workflow**
   - Start workflow called "IT Compliance Reporting Dashboard"
   - Add scheduled triggers for daily compliance checks and monthly report generation

2. **Infrastructure Compliance Scanning**
   - Add "HTTP Request" nodes to query IT monitoring systems:
     - Security patch status across all systems
     - System configuration compliance with security baselines
     - Network security controls and firewall rule compliance
     - Access control reviews and privileged account management
   - Use "OpenAI" node to assess compliance gaps and risk levels

3. **Regulatory Requirements Monitoring**
   - Monitor compliance with specific regulations based on industry:
     - HIPAA: Healthcare data protection and access controls
     - PCI-DSS: Payment card data security requirements
     - SOX: Financial systems controls and change management
     - GDPR: Data privacy and protection controls
   - Track compliance metrics and generate exception reports

4. **Security Audit Trail Generation**
   - Collect security events and configuration changes from IT systems
   - Generate audit trails for:
     - System access and authentication events
     - Data access and modification logs
     - Configuration changes and approval workflows
     - Security incident response and remediation actions

5. **Dashboard Creation & Report Distribution**
   - Create real-time compliance dashboards showing:
     - Overall compliance score and trending
     - Critical compliance gaps requiring immediate attention
     - Upcoming compliance deadlines and renewal dates
     - Audit readiness status across all IT systems
   - Automatically distribute reports to management and compliance teams

**Alternative: Make.com Setup**

1. **Create IT Compliance Scenario**
   - Name scenario "IT Compliance Reporting Dashboard"
   - Add "Schedule > Run at specified times" for regular compliance monitoring

2. **Data Collection Pipeline**
   - Add "HTTP > Make a request" for IT monitoring system queries
   - Use "JSON > Parse JSON" for processing compliance data
   - Include "Filter" modules to identify compliance violations

3. **Compliance Analysis**
   - Add "OpenAI > Create a chat completion" for risk assessment
   - Use "Math > Perform a function" for compliance score calculations
   - Include "Aggregator" for consolidating compliance data

4. **Reporting & Visualization**
   - Add "Power BI > Create a dataset" for dashboard creation
   - Use "Email > Send an email" for automated report distribution
   - Include "Slack > Create a message" for critical compliance alerts
