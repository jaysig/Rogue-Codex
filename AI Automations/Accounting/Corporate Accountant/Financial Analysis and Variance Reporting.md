## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get financial variance analysis without automation setup. Perfect for smaller companies or one-time analysis needs:

### Quick Variance Analysis Prompt

```
I need help analyzing financial variances for my company. Here's my data:

Financial Performance:
- Actual results: [paste your actual financial data]
- Budget/plan: [paste your budget numbers]
- Prior year: [paste prior year comparisons if available]
- Key business metrics: [revenue drivers, cost metrics, etc.]

Analysis needed:
- [specify which variances are most important]
- [mention any specific areas of concern]
- [indicate your audience - executives, board, etc.]

Please act as a senior financial analyst and:

1. Calculate key variances (amount and percentage)
2. Identify the most significant variances that need attention
3. Provide possible explanations for major variances
4. Suggest business implications and recommended actions
5. Create an executive summary suitable for leadership presentation

Format the analysis with clear sections and highlight the most critical insights for decision-making.
```

### JSON Template for Structured Analysis

```
Please provide the variance analysis in this structured format:

{
  "executive_summary": "...",
  "key_variances": [
    {
      "line_item": "...",
      "actual": "...",
      "budget": "...",
      "variance_amount": "...",
      "variance_percent": "...",
      "significance": "high/medium/low",
      "likely_causes": ["...", "..."],
      "business_impact": "...",
      "recommended_actions": ["...", "..."]
    }
  ],
  "overall_performance_assessment": "...",
  "key_recommendations": ["...", "...", "..."]
}
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **Manual data entry**: Need to input financial data for each analysis
- **No real-time monitoring**: Can't track performance continuously
- **Limited historical context**: No automated trending or pattern recognition
- **One-time insights**: Each analysis is independent without learning

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you need regular variance analysis, have multiple business units to analyze, or want continuous performance monitoring and alerting.
