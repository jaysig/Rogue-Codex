## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get regulatory compliance analysis without full automation setup. Use this approach for smaller companies or one-time assessments:

### Quick Compliance Assessment Prompt

```
I need help analyzing regulatory reporting requirements for my company. Here's my situation:

Company details:
- Industry: [your industry]
- Revenue: [annual revenue]
- Public/Private: [status]
- Jurisdictions: [where you operate]

Current challenges:
- [describe your main compliance challenges]
- [list current manual processes taking too much time]
- [mention any upcoming regulatory changes you're aware of]

Please act as a regulatory compliance expert and:

1. Identify the key regulatory reporting requirements for my company
2. Suggest automation opportunities for the most time-intensive processes
3. Recommend tools and platforms appropriate for my company size
4. Provide a prioritized implementation roadmap
5. Estimate potential time savings and ROI

Focus on practical, actionable recommendations that I can implement with my current resources.
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **No real-time monitoring**: Can't track regulatory changes automatically
- **Manual updates**: Need to re-analyze when requirements change
- **No integration**: Results aren't connected to your financial systems
- **Limited validation**: No automated accuracy checks or controls

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you have multiple regulatory requirements, need consistent deadline management, or want integrated compliance monitoring across your organization.
