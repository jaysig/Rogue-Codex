# Client Engagement Management System

Comprehensive automation platform for Big 4 accounting firm professionals to manage multiple client engagements simultaneously, streamline project coordination, and optimize deliverable management while maintaining firm quality standards and client service excellence.

**Who This Helps:** Associates, senior associates, managers handling multiple client engagements across audit, tax, and advisory services  
**Tools Used:** Firm platforms (Aura, Atlas, Omnia, KWorld), project management tools, automation platforms (n8n, Make.com)  
**Time Saved:** 12-18 hours per week on engagement administration  
**Results:** 50% improvement in project coordination, 70% reduction in missed deadlines

## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get engagement management support without full automation setup. Perfect for smaller engagements or one-time project coordination:

### Quick Engagement Planning Prompt

```
I need help organizing multiple client engagements. Here's my current situation:

Active Engagements:
- Client 1: [engagement type, key deliverables, timeline]
- Client 2: [engagement type, key deliverables, timeline]
- Client 3: [engagement type, key deliverables, timeline]
- [add additional clients as needed]

Current challenges:
- [describe your main coordination challenges]
- [list any resource constraints or conflicts]
- [mention upcoming deadlines or critical milestones]

Please act as a senior engagement manager and:

1. Create a prioritized timeline for all deliverables
2. Identify potential scheduling conflicts and resource constraints
3. Suggest coordination strategies for managing multiple engagements
4. Recommend client communication schedules and touchpoints
5. Provide a weekly action plan for the next 4 weeks

Focus on realistic, actionable coordination strategies that I can implement immediately.
```

### Project Coordination Template

```
Please organize this in a structured format:

{
  "engagement_overview": {
    "total_active_engagements": "...",
    "critical_deadlines": ["...", "..."],
    "resource_constraints": ["...", "..."]
  },
  "weekly_priorities": [
    {
      "week": "Week 1",
      "primary_focus": "...",
      "key_deliverables": ["...", "..."],
      "client_communications": ["...", "..."],
      "potential_conflicts": "..."
    }
  ],
  "coordination_strategies": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "risk_mitigation": ["...", "...", "..."]
}
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **Manual updates**: Need to re-plan when engagement details change
- **No real-time tracking**: Can't monitor progress automatically
- **Limited integration**: No connection to firm systems or time tracking
- **Static planning**: No dynamic adjustment for changing priorities

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you regularly manage 5+ simultaneous engagements, need integrated time tracking, or want automated client communication and progress monitoring.
