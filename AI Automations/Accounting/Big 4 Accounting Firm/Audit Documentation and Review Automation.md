## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get audit documentation support without full automation setup. Perfect for smaller engagements or specific documentation needs:

### Quick Audit Documentation Prompt

```
I need help creating audit documentation for [specific audit area]. Here's my situation:

Audit Context:
- Client: [client name and industry]
- Audit area: [specific account or process]
- Key risks: [identified risks and concerns]
- Procedures performed: [list of audit procedures completed]
- Results: [key findings and observations]

Documentation needs:
- [specify type of work paper needed]
- [mention any firm-specific requirements]
- [note any complex judgments or conclusions]

Please act as a senior audit manager and:

1. Create a properly structured work paper with standard sections
2. Include appropriate cross-references and procedure documentation
3. Suggest conclusion language based on procedures performed
4. Identify any additional procedures or documentation needed
5. Format according to professional auditing standards

Focus on clear, professional documentation that meets auditing standards and firm requirements.
```

### Work Paper Structure Template

```
Please format the work paper using this structure:

{
  "work_paper_header": {
    "client": "...",
    "audit_area": "...",
    "period": "...",
    "preparer": "...",
    "reviewer": "..."
  },
  "procedures_performed": [
    {
      "procedure": "...",
      "results": "...",
      "exceptions": "..."
    }
  ],
  "key_judgments": ["...", "..."],
  "conclusions": "...",
  "cross_references": ["...", "..."],
  "review_notes": ["...", "..."]
}
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **Manual formatting**: Need to apply firm-specific formatting manually
- **No integration**: No connection to audit platforms or review systems
- **Limited templates**: Each work paper starts from scratch
- **No automated routing**: Manual coordination of review processes

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you regularly prepare multiple work papers, need integrated review workflows, or want automated quality control and compliance checking.
