# Research and Technical Analysis Engine

AI-powered automation system for Big 4 professionals to accelerate technical research, accounting standards analysis, and industry intelligence gathering while maintaining the depth and accuracy required for client advisory work and technical decision-making.

## What This Is

Big 4 professionals regularly conduct complex technical research across accounting standards (GAAP, IFRS), industry regulations, and client-specific technical issues. This automation synthesizes information from multiple authoritative sources, creates structured analysis, and maintains research documentation that meets professional standards.

**Who This Helps:** Associates, senior associates, managers working on technical accounting issues, advisory engagements, and complex client problems  
**Tools Used:** Research databases (FASB, IASB, SEC), AI analysis tools, automation platforms (n8n, Make.com), firm knowledge management  
**Time Saved:** 8-12 hours per week on research and technical analysis  
**Results:** 70% faster research completion, comprehensive analysis documentation, improved technical accuracy

## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get technical research support without full automation setup. Perfect for one-time technical issues or smaller research needs:

### Quick Technical Research Prompt

```
I need help researching a technical accounting issue. Here's my situation:

Technical Issue:
- Topic: [describe the specific accounting or auditing issue]
- Context: [provide relevant background and circumstances]
- Industry: [client industry if relevant]
- Standards: [mention relevant GAAP, IFRS, or other standards]
- Specific questions: [list your specific technical questions]

Research needs:
- [specify what type of guidance you're looking for]
- [mention any precedents or similar situations]
- [note any regulatory or compliance considerations]

Please act as a technical accounting expert and:

1. Identify the relevant authoritative guidance and standards
2. Analyze the specific technical requirements and interpretations
3. Provide clear conclusions and recommendations
4. Suggest implementation considerations and practical implications
5. Include proper citations and references for all guidance

Focus on authoritative sources and provide clear, actionable technical guidance.
```

### Technical Analysis Template

```
Please structure the technical analysis as follows:

{
  "executive_summary": "...",
  "relevant_standards": [
    {
      "source": "...",
      "citation": "...",
      "key_requirements": "..."
    }
  ],
  "technical_analysis": {
    "issue_identification": "...",
    "standards_application": "...",
    "interpretive_considerations": "..."
  },
  "conclusions_and_recommendations": ["...", "..."],
  "implementation_considerations": ["...", "..."],
  "additional_research_needed": ["...", "..."]
}
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **Limited database access**: Can't search proprietary research databases directly
- **No real-time updates**: May not include the most recent standards or interpretations
- **Manual documentation**: Need to format and document research manually
- **No knowledge retention**: Each research request starts from scratch

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you regularly conduct technical research, need access to multiple proprietary databases, or want to build institutional knowledge for future reference.
