## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get business development support without full automation setup. Perfect for specific opportunities or strategic planning:

### Quick Business Development Prompt

```
I need help with a business development opportunity. Here's the situation:

Opportunity Details:
- Prospect: [company name and industry]
- Estimated value: [potential annual fees]
- Services needed: [specific service requirements]
- Competition: [known or suspected competitors]
- Timeline: [decision timeline and key dates]

Our Position:
- Relationship strength: [current relationship status]
- Relevant experience: [similar clients or industries]
- Team capabilities: [available resources and expertise]
- Differentiation: [our competitive advantages]

Challenges:
- [describe main challenges or obstacles]
- [mention any concerns or risk factors]
- [note any resource constraints]

Please act as a business development strategist and:

1. Assess our competitive position and win probability
2. Identify key differentiators and value propositions
3. Suggest proposal strategy and positioning approach
4. Recommend team composition and resource allocation
5. Provide a pursuit plan with key actions and timeline

Focus on practical strategies that maximize our chance of winning this opportunity.
```

### Proposal Strategy Template

```
Please structure the business development strategy as follows:

{
  "opportunity_assessment": {
    "win_probability": "...",
    "key_decision_factors": ["...", "..."],
    "competitive_threats": ["...", "..."],
    "strategic_importance": "..."
  },
  "positioning_strategy": {
    "primary_value_proposition": "...",
    "key_differentiators": ["...", "..."],
    "proof_points": ["...", "..."]
  },
  "pursuit_plan": [
    {
      "phase": "...",
      "objectives": ["...", "..."],
      "key_actions": ["...", "..."],
      "timeline": "...",
      "resources_needed": ["...", "..."]
    }
  ],
  "risk_mitigation": ["...", "...", "..."]
}
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **Manual coordination**: Need to coordinate proposal activities manually
- **No ongoing tracking**: Can't monitor opportunity progression automatically
- **Limited intelligence**: No automated competitive or market intelligence
- **Static planning**: No dynamic adjustment for changing opportunity conditions

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you regularly manage multiple business development opportunities, need integrated proposal coordination, or want automated competitive intelligence and partnership management.
