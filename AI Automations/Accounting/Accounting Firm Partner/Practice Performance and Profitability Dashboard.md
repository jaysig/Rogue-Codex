## üí° LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can get practice performance analysis without full automation setup. Perfect for smaller firms or periodic practice reviews:

### Quick Practice Analysis Prompt

```
I need help analyzing my accounting practice performance. Here's my current data:

Practice Metrics:
- Total revenue: [annual/monthly revenue]
- Number of clients: [active client count]
- Staff count: [professional staff numbers]
- Key service lines: [audit, tax, advisory, etc.]
- Average billing rates: [by staff level/service type]

Current challenges:
- [describe main practice management challenges]
- [mention any profitability concerns]
- [note any capacity or utilization issues]

Please act as a practice management consultant and:

1. Calculate key performance indicators for my practice
2. Identify areas of strength and improvement opportunities
3. Suggest specific actions to improve profitability and efficiency
4. Recommend metrics I should track regularly
5. Provide benchmarking insights for practices of similar size

Focus on actionable recommendations that I can implement to improve practice performance.
```

### Performance Analysis Template

```
Please structure the analysis using this format:

{
  "practice_overview": {
    "size_category": "...",
    "revenue_per_professional": "...",
    "utilization_estimate": "..."
  },
  "key_metrics": [
    {
      "metric": "...",
      "current_performance": "...",
      "benchmark": "...",
      "assessment": "strong/adequate/needs_improvement"
    }
  ],
  "improvement_opportunities": [
    {
      "area": "...",
      "current_issue": "...",
      "recommended_action": "...",
      "expected_impact": "..."
    }
  ],
  "action_plan": ["...", "...", "..."]
}
```

### Limitations of LLM-Only Approach
- **Manual data entry**: Need to input performance data for each analysis
- **No real-time monitoring**: Can't track performance continuously
- **Limited benchmarking**: No access to real-time industry benchmarks
- **Static analysis**: Each review is independent without trending

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you want continuous performance monitoring, need real-time client profitability analysis, or want automated alerting for performance exceptions and opportunities.
