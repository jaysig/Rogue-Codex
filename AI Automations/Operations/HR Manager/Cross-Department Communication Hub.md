**What It Does:** Automatically coordinates HR communications across departments, eliminates information silos, and ensures consistent messaging for policy changes, organizational updates, and cross-functional HR initiatives.

**How It Works:**
1. Centralizes all HR communications and automatically routes to appropriate departments
2. Translates HR policies into department-specific guidance and action items
3. Tracks communication delivery, acknowledgment, and implementation across teams
4. Coordinates cross-functional HR projects with automated status updates and milestone tracking
5. Creates feedback loops to ensure two-way communication between HR and departments

**What You Need:**
- Communication platforms (Slack, Microsoft Teams, email systems)

     - Determine communication urgency and required actions
     - Generate department-specific messaging and guidance
     - Create follow-up schedules based on message type

     - Operations: Emphasize workflow impacts, staffing changes, process updates
     - Sales: Highlight customer-facing impacts, territory changes, commission updates
     - IT: Address system changes, access requirements, security implications

4. **Delivery Tracking & Acknowledgment**
   - Send communications through appropriate channels (Slack, email, team meetings)
   - Track message delivery and read receipts where available
   - Send automated follow-up reminders for unacknowledged critical messages
   - Create dashboard showing communication status across all departments

5. **Feedback Collection & Response Management**
   - Set up automated surveys for policy feedback and implementation challenges
   - Monitor department-specific Slack channels for HR-related discussions
   - Aggregate feedback and create summary reports for HR leadership
