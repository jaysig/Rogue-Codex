# Compliance Monitoring and Alert System

**What It Does:** Automatically monitors HR compliance requirements, tracks regulatory changes, maintains documentation for audits, and sends proactive alerts for upcoming deadlines or compliance violations.

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors regulatory websites and legal databases for HR compliance updates
2. Tracks employee records for compliance requirements (I-9, background checks, certifications)
3. Automatically generates compliance reports and audit documentation
4. Sends proactive alerts for expiring certifications, missing documentation, or regulatory deadlines
5. Creates action plans for compliance remediation and tracks completion

**What You Need:**
- HRIS system with employee records and document storage
- Legal/compliance database access (SHRM, employment law services)
- Document management system for compliance records
- Calendar and notification systems for deadline tracking

**Step-by-Step n8n Setup:**

1. **Create Compliance Monitoring Workflow**
   - Start workflow called "Compliance Monitoring and Alert System"
   - Add scheduled triggers for daily compliance checks and weekly regulatory scans

2. **Regulatory Change Monitoring**
   - Add "HTTP Request" nodes to monitor:
     - EEOC updates and guidance changes
     - DOL wage and hour regulation updates
     - State employment law changes
     - OSHA workplace safety requirements
   - Use "OpenAI" node to summarize regulatory changes and assess impact

3. **Employee Compliance Tracking**
   - Query HRIS for employee records requiring compliance monitoring:
     - I-9 form completion and reverification dates
     - Background check expiration dates
     - Required training completion status
     - Professional certification renewals
   - Cross-reference with compliance calendars and deadlines

4. **Document Compliance Verification**
   - Scan document management system for:
     - Missing or incomplete compliance documentation
     - Documents approaching retention deadlines
     - Audit trail completeness for regulatory reviews
     - Data privacy and security compliance records

5. **Alert Generation & Action Planning**
   - Create prioritized alerts for different compliance urgency levels:
     - Critical: Immediate violation risk (send instant alerts)
     - High: 30-day deadline approaching (weekly reminders)
     - Medium: 90-day planning horizon (monthly reports)
   - Generate specific action plans with responsible parties and deadlines

**Alternative: Make.com Setup**

1. **Create HR Compliance Scenario**
   - Name scenario "Compliance Monitoring and Alert System"
   - Add "Schedule > Run at specified times" for regular compliance checks

2. **Regulatory Monitoring Pipeline**
   - Add "HTTP > Make a request" for regulatory website monitoring
   - Use "RSS > Retrieve RSS feed items" for legal update feeds
   - Include "OpenAI > Create a chat completion" for impact analysis

3. **Employee Data Analysis**
   - Add "Database > Select rows" to query HRIS compliance data
   - Use "Date & time > Add/subtract time" to calculate compliance deadlines
   - Include "Filter" modules to identify at-risk compliance areas

4. **Alert and Reporting System**
   - Add "Email > Send an email" for compliance alerts
   - Use "Slack > Create a message" for team notifications
   - Include "Google Docs > Create a document" for compliance reports
