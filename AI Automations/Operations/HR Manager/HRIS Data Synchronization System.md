# HRIS Data Synchronization System

**What It Does:** Automatically synchronizes employee data across multiple HR systems, eliminates manual data entry, and ensures consistent information across payroll, benefits, performance management, and other HR platforms.

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors changes in primary HRIS system (new hires, terminations, role changes)
2. Automatically updates secondary systems (payroll, benefits, directory services)
3. Validates data consistency and flags discrepancies for review
4. Creates audit trails for all data changes and synchronization events
5. Sends alerts for failed synchronizations or data conflicts

**What You Need:**
- Primary HRIS system (BambooHR, Workday, ADP, etc.)
- Secondary HR systems (payroll, benefits, performance management)
- API access or integration capabilities for all systems
- Data mapping and transformation rules

**Step-by-Step n8n Setup:**

1. **Create Data Sync Workflow**
   - Start workflow called "HRIS Data Synchronization System"
   - Add webhook triggers for HRIS system changes (new hire, termination, updates)

2. **Data Validation & Mapping**
   - Add "Code" node to validate incoming data:
     - Employee ID format validation
     - Required field completeness check
     - Data type and format consistency
     - Business rule validation (reporting structure, department codes)
   - Map data fields between different system formats

3. **Multi-System Updates**
   - Use "HTTP Request" nodes for each target system:
     - Payroll system: Update employee records, salary, tax info
     - Benefits system: Enroll/terminate coverage, dependent updates
     - Directory services: Create/update accounts, group memberships
     - Performance system: Manager assignments, goal tracking setup

4. **Error Handling & Alerts**
   - Add "Switch" node to handle different response types
   - Create error logging for failed synchronizations
   - Send Slack/email alerts for data conflicts or system failures
   - Queue failed updates for manual review and retry

5. **Audit Trail Creation**
   - Log all data changes with timestamps and source system
   - Track which systems were updated successfully
   - Create compliance reports for data modification history
   - Store synchronization metrics for performance monitoring

**Alternative: Make.com Setup**

1. **Create HR Data Sync Scenario**
   - Name scenario "HRIS Data Synchronization System"
   - Add webhooks from primary HRIS system for employee changes

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**
   - Add "Data transformer" module for field mapping
   - Use "Tools > Compose" for data validation rules
   - Include "Filter" modules for different update types

3. **System Integration**
   - Add modules for each target system:
     - "HTTP > Make a request" for API-based systems
     - Dedicated connectors where available (ADP, Workday, etc.)
     - "Database > Insert/Update" for custom systems

4. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Add "Error handler" routes for each integration
   - Use "Slack > Create a message" for failure notifications
   - Include "Google Sheets > Add a row" for audit logging

ðŸ’¡ **Make MCP Tip**: Use the [Make MCP server](https://github.com/integromat/make-mcp-server) with Claude Code to build HR data sync scenarios with pre-built HR system connectors.

**What You Get:**
- Eliminate 4-6 hours/week of manual data entry across HR systems
- Ensure 99% data consistency across all HR platforms
- Reduce employee onboarding time from days to hours
- Create comprehensive audit trails for compliance and reporting
- Prevent data entry errors that cause payroll and benefits issues
