## LLM-Only Alternative

**Quick Solution:** If you just need basic interview coordination done occasionally...

Many recruiters can handle simple scheduling and communication tasks through conversation with Claude, especially for one-off interviews or basic candidate outreach. This works well for small-scale recruiting or occasional hiring needs.

**Multi-Step Prompt Example:**
```
I'm a recruiter coordinating interviews for [Position]. Here's my situation:
[Candidate details: name, availability, preferences]
[Interview team: names, roles, availability constraints]
[Interview format: in-person/video, duration, special requirements]
[Timeline: urgency, preferred dates]

Please help me:
1. Find optimal interview times for all parties
2. Draft professional scheduling emails
3. Create interview confirmation details
4. Plan follow-up communication timeline
```

**JSON Template for Interview Coordination:**
```json
{
  "interview_coordination": {
    "candidate": "Name",
    "position": "Role Title",
    "interview_type": "phone/video/in-person",
    "duration": "30/60/90 minutes",
    "participants": ["Interviewer 1", "Interviewer 2"],
    "optimal_times": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
    "preparation_materials": ["Job description", "Portfolio review", "Technical requirements"]
  },
  "communication_plan": {
    "confirmation_email": "Draft text",
    "reminder_sequence": ["24hr reminder", "2hr reminder"],
    "follow_up_timeline": "Next steps and timing"
  }
}
```

**Limitations:** This approach can't automate ongoing coordination, connect to calendar systems, or provide real-time scheduling. Good for planning and one-time coordination, but not operational automation.

**When to Upgrade:** If you're scheduling 5+ interviews per week, managing multiple hiring processes, or need real-time calendar coordination, the full automation becomes essential for efficiency.
