# Due Diligence & Data Room Analyzer

**What It Does:** Automatically processes hundreds of documents in M&A data rooms, extracts key insights, identifies red flags, and generates preliminary analysis reports.

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors data room uploads and downloads all new documents
2. Uses AI to categorize documents (financial, legal, operational, strategic)
3. Extracts key metrics, dates, and risk factors from each document type
4. Cross-references information to identify inconsistencies or red flags
5. Generates structured analysis reports with findings and recommendations

**What You Need:**
- Data room access (Intralinks, Merrill DatSite, SS&C)
- Document processing AI (Claude, GPT-4, or specialized tools)
- Financial analysis templates
- Red flag identification rules

## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

1. **Create Due Diligence Workflow**
   - Start workflow called "Due Diligence & Data Room Analyzer"
   - Add "HTTP Request" trigger to monitor data room API for new uploads

2. **Document Classification**
   - Add "Extract from File" node to read document content
   - Use "OpenAI" node with prompt: "Categorize this document as: Financial Statements, Legal Contracts, Operational Reports, Strategic Plans, HR Documents, or Other. Extract key metrics and dates."
   - Route documents by type using "Switch" node

3. **Financial Analysis Automation**
   - For financial docs: Extract revenue, EBITDA, cash flow, debt levels
   - Calculate key ratios and growth rates automatically
   - Compare against industry benchmarks
   - Flag unusual trends or outliers

4. **Red Flag Detection**
   - Use "IF" nodes to check for common red flags:
     - Revenue concentration (>30% from single customer)
     - Declining margins over 2+ years
     - High executive turnover
     - Pending litigation over $X threshold
   - Generate alerts for critical issues

5. **Report Generation**
   - Compile findings into structured reports by category
   - Include executive summary with key risks and opportunities
   - Create data visualization charts for trends
   - Email reports to engagement team

## Alternative: Make.com Setup

1. **Create Data Room Analysis Scenario**
   - Name scenario "Due Diligence & Data Room Analyzer"
   - Add data room webhook trigger for new documents

   - Add "OpenAI > Create a chat completion" for document analysis
   - Extract structured data based on document type
   - Identify key business metrics and risk factors

3. **Financial Analysis Engine**
