# Post-Merger Integration & Organizational Mapper

**What It Does:** Analyzes organizational structures from multiple entities, identifies redundancies, maps reporting relationships, and recommends integration strategies.

**How It Works:**
1. Ingests org charts, job descriptions, and employee data from merging entities
2. Maps roles, responsibilities, and reporting structures using AI analysis
3. Identifies overlapping functions and potential redundancies
4. Analyzes compensation disparities and cultural differences
5. Generates integration recommendations with timeline and cost estimates

**What You Need:**
- HRIS system access (Workday, BambooHR, ADP)
- Organizational data (job descriptions, comp data, performance reviews)
- Org chart visualization tools
- Cultural assessment surveys

## Step-by-Step n8n Setup

1. **Create PMI Mapping Workflow**
   - Start workflow called "Post-Merger Integration & Organizational Mapper"
   - Add "HRIS" triggers to pull employee data from both entities

2. **Role Analysis & Mapping**
   - Use "OpenAI" node to analyze job descriptions and extract:
     - Core responsibilities and skills required
     - Reporting relationships and team structures
     - Compensation levels and performance ratings
   - Map similar roles across both organizations

3. **Redundancy Identification**
   - Add "Code" node to calculate overlap percentages:
     - Same role + same department = 95% overlap
     - Similar role + different department = 60% overlap
     - Different role + same manager = 30% overlap
   - Flag positions for further review

4. **Cultural Integration Analysis**
   - Analyze communication patterns, work styles, values alignment
   - Identify potential cultural conflicts or synergies
   - Recommend integration strategies by department

5. **Integration Planning**
   - Generate org charts for proposed future state
   - Calculate cost savings from redundancy elimination
   - Create implementation timeline with key milestones
   - Identify key talent retention risks

## Alternative: Make.com Setup

1. **Create PMI Analysis Scenario**
   - Name scenario "Post-Merger Integration & Organizational Mapper"
   - Add "HRIS > Get employees" from both organizations

2. **AI-Powered Role Mapping**
   - Add "OpenAI > Create a chat completion" for job description analysis
   - Map roles and identify functional overlaps
   - Analyze compensation and performance data

3. **Redundancy and Risk Analysis**
   - Use "Math > Perform a function" for overlap calculations
   - Add "Filter" modules for high-risk scenarios
   - Identify key talent retention priorities

4. **Integration Recommendations**
   - Add "Google Sheets > Add row" for tracking analysis
   - Generate visual org charts and integration plans
   - Create implementation timeline and cost estimates

## What You Get
- Complete organizational overlap analysis in days instead of months
- Data-driven redundancy identification and cost estimates
- Cultural integration risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Clear implementation roadmap with success metrics
