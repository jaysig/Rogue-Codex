**What this approach can't do:**
- Won't automatically schedule appointments or send reminders
- No real-time exercise compliance tracking or patient monitoring
- Can't integrate with scheduling systems or exercise apps automatically
- Limited to planning rather than execution of patient management

**When to upgrade to full automation:**
- You have consistent patient volume requiring systematic scheduling and exercise management
- You need real-time compliance tracking and automated patient communication
- You want integrated scheduling and exercise program delivery systems
- You have complex practice management needs requiring comprehensive automation
