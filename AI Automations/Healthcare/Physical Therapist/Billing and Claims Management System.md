## üè• Individual Workflows

### Workflow 1: 8-Minute Rule Automation and Unit Calculation
Automatically calculates billable units based on treatment time and ensures compliance with Medicare's 8-minute rule for accurate billing.

**What It Does:**
- Tracks actual treatment time per CPT code automatically
- Calculates billable units using 8-minute rule methodology
- Flags potential billing errors before claims submission
- Generates compliant documentation for audit purposes

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

**n8n Setup:**
1. **Time Tracking Integration**: Connect to EMR or practice management system to capture treatment start/end times
2. **Unit Calculation Logic**: Create formula nodes that apply 8-minute rule calculations automatically
3. **Compliance Checking**: Add validation nodes to flag potential billing rule violations
4. **Documentation Generation**: Auto-populate billing forms with calculated units and supporting documentation

**Make.com Setup:**
1. **EMR Connection**: Use HTTP modules to pull treatment session data from practice management system
2. **Calculation Module**: Create custom formula scenarios for 8-minute rule compliance
3. **Error Detection**: Set up conditional logic to identify billing discrepancies
4. **Report Generation**: Auto-create billing summaries with unit justifications

### Workflow 2: CPT Code Verification and Prior Authorization
Automatically verifies correct CPT codes for PT treatments and manages insurance pre-authorization requirements.

**What It Does:**
- Matches treatment notes to appropriate CPT codes automatically
- Verifies insurance coverage for specific PT codes before treatment
- Submits prior authorization requests with required documentation
- Tracks approval status and updates patient eligibility

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

**n8n Setup:**
1. **Code Matching**: Create lookup tables linking treatment types to correct CPT codes
2. **Insurance API Integration**: Connect to payer systems for real-time eligibility verification
3. **Prior Auth Workflow**: Automate submission of authorization requests with required documentation
4. **Status Tracking**: Monitor approval/denial status and update patient records automatically

**Make.com Setup:**
1. **Treatment Analysis**: Use AI modules to analyze treatment notes and suggest appropriate codes
2. **Payer Integration**: Connect to insurance verification services through API modules
3. **Authorization Pipeline**: Create automated workflows for prior auth submission and tracking
4. **Alert System**: Set up notifications for authorization approvals, denials, or expiration dates

### Workflow 3: Claims Processing and Denial Management
Streamlines claims submission and automatically handles common denial reasons with reprocessing workflows.

**What It Does:**
- Submits clean claims with complete documentation automatically
- Identifies and corrects common denial reasons before resubmission
- Tracks claim status and payment timelines
- Generates appeal documentation for denied claims

**Step-by-Step Implementation:**

**n8n Setup:**
1. **Claims Validation**: Pre-submission checking for missing modifiers, incorrect codes, or documentation gaps
2. **Submission Automation**: Direct electronic submission to clearinghouses or payers
3. **Status Monitoring**: Regular checking of claim status through payer portals
4. **Denial Processing**: Automated correction and resubmission of correctable denials

**Make.com Setup:**
1. **Quality Control**: Multi-step validation scenarios before claims submission
2. **Electronic Submission**: Integration with billing clearinghouses for direct submission
3. **Tracking Dashboard**: Centralized monitoring of all submitted claims and their status
4. **Appeal Generation**: Automated creation of appeal letters with supporting documentation

## üöÄ Getting Started Guide

### Phase 1: Time Tracking Setup (Week 1-2)
Start by implementing automated time tracking for accurate 8-minute rule compliance. This immediately reduces coding errors and audit risk.

### Phase 2: Code Verification (Week 3-4)
Add CPT code verification to ensure treatments are billed with appropriate codes. This reduces claim denials significantly.

### Phase 3: Claims Processing (Week 5-6)
Implement automated claims submission and tracking. This accelerates payment cycles and reduces administrative overhead.

### Phase 4: Denial Management (Week 7-8)
Add denial processing and appeal workflows. This maximizes reimbursement and reduces revenue leakage.

**Budget Planning:**
- Start with basic 8-minute rule automation: $150-300/month
- Add code verification and prior auth: +$100-200/month
- Full claims management: Total $300-600/month depending on practice size
