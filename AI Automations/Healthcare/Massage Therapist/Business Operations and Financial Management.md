## LLM-Only Alternative

**Quick Solution:** If you just need basic financial tracking done once or occasionally...

Many massage therapists can handle basic business management tasks through conversation with Claude, especially for quarterly reviews or annual planning. This works well for simple income/expense tracking and basic client follow-up planning.

**Multi-Step Prompt Example:**
```
I'm a massage therapist and need help organizing my business finances. Here's my information:
[Monthly income: $X]
[Monthly expenses: list main categories]
[Client count: X per month]
[Business goals: describe]

Please help me:
1. Calculate my quarterly tax estimate
2. Identify expense categories I should track
3. Create a client retention plan
4. Suggest pricing adjustments based on profitability
```

**JSON Template for Financial Tracking:**
```json
{
  "monthly_summary": {
    "income": "$X",
    "expenses": {
      "supplies": "$X",
      "rent": "$X",
      "marketing": "$X",
      "insurance": "$X"
    },
    "profit_margin": "X%",
    "quarterly_tax_estimate": "$X"
  },
  "client_metrics": {
    "new_clients": X,
    "returning_clients": X,
    "retention_rate": "X%",
    "average_session_value": "$X"
  }
}
```

**Limitations:** This approach can't automate ongoing tracking, connect to payment systems, or provide real-time business insights. Good for planning and analysis, but not operational automation.

**When to Upgrade:** If you're doing this monthly, have multiple income sources, or want automated client communication, the full automation becomes worth the setup time and cost.
