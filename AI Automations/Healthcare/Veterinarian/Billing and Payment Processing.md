## LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can use Claude or ChatGPT to create billing templates. Copy this prompt:

```
I'm a veterinarian and need help creating billing templates. Please create professional templates for:

1. Itemized invoice for veterinary services
2. Payment reminder messages (gentle to firm)
3. Insurance claim documentation
4. Payment plan agreement

Include these details:
- Pet name: [PET_NAME]
- Owner name: [OWNER_NAME]
- Services provided: [SERVICES]
- Medications used: [MEDICATIONS]
