## LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can use Claude or ChatGPT to create SOAP notes without any automation setup. Just copy and paste this prompt:

```
I'm a veterinarian and need help creating a SOAP note. Here are my observations from the patient visit:

[Paste your notes here]

Please create a professional veterinary SOAP note including:
- Subjective: Client concerns and history
- Objective: Physical exam findings and vital signs  
- Assessment: Medical diagnosis and condition
- Plan: Treatment recommendations and follow-up

Format it professionally for medical records and include any relevant compliance notes.
```

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you're creating more than 10 SOAP notes per week, the automation will save significant time and ensure consistency.

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this work with my current veterinary software?**
A: Yes! This connects to most major veterinary systems (Cornerstone, ezyVet, IDEXX, etc.). We use their existing connections.

**Q: What if the AI makes mistakes in medical records?**
A: Always review AI-generated notes before finalizing. The system speeds up documentation but doesn't replace veterinary judgment.

**Q: Is this HIPAA compliant?**
A: When set up properly with compliant services, yes. We'll help you choose HIPAA-compliant voice processing and storage options.

**Q: How accurate is voice-to-text for veterinary terms?**
A: Very good with proper setup. The system learns veterinary vocabulary and improves over time. Medical terms become more accurate with use.

## Success Stories

**Dr. Sarah's Small Animal Clinic:**
"Went from 45 minutes of documentation per day to 10 minutes. Now I can see more patients and actually talk to pet owners instead of typing all the time."

**Metro Veterinary Hospital:**
"Our SOAP notes are more consistent now, and new vets can document properly from day one. Compliance audits are so much easier."
