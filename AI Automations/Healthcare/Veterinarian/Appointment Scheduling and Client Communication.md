## LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can use Claude or ChatGPT to create appointment reminder templates without automation. Copy this prompt:

```
I'm a veterinarian and need help creating appointment reminder messages. Please create templates for:

1. Initial appointment confirmation (24-48 hours before)
2. Day-of reminder with preparation instructions  
3. Emergency appointment rapid response
4. Follow-up appointment scheduling

Include these details:
- Pet name: [PET_NAME]
- Owner name: [OWNER_NAME] 
- Appointment type: [APPOINTMENT_TYPE]
- Date/time: [DATE_TIME]
- Special instructions: [INSTRUCTIONS]

Make the tone professional but warm, and include preparation instructions for common appointment types (wellness exams, surgery, etc.).
```

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you're sending more than 20 appointment reminders per week, automation saves hours and reduces no-shows significantly.
