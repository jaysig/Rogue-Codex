## LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can use Claude or ChatGPT to create inventory tracking templates. Copy this prompt:

```
I'm a veterinarian and need help creating an inventory management system. Please create templates for:

1. Daily medication usage log
2. Reorder point calculations
3. Controlled substance tracking
4. Expiration date monitoring

Include these fields:
- Medication name: [MEDICATION]
- Current quantity: [QUANTITY]
- Daily usage rate: [USAGE_RATE]
- Lead time for reorder: [LEAD_TIME]
- Minimum stock level: [MIN_STOCK]

Create formulas to calculate when to reorder each medication based on usage patterns and lead times.
```

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you're managing more than 50 different medications or have controlled substances, automation prevents costly mistakes and ensures compliance.
