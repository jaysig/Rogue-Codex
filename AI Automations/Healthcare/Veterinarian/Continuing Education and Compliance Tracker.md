## LLM-Only Alternative

**If you just need this done once or occasionally...**

You can use Claude or ChatGPT to create compliance tracking templates. Copy this prompt:

```
I'm a veterinarian and need help creating a continuing education tracking system. Please create templates for:

1. License renewal tracking spreadsheet
2. CE requirement calculator by state
3. Professional development planning
4. Compliance documentation checklist

Include these details for each license:
- State: [STATE]
- License number: [LICENSE_NUMBER]
- Renewal date: [RENEWAL_DATE]
- CE hours required: [CE_HOURS]
- Completed hours: [COMPLETED_HOURS]
- Specializations: [SPECIALIZATIONS]

Create formulas to calculate remaining requirements and time until deadlines.
```

**When to upgrade to full automation:** If you're licensed in more than 2 states or have multiple certifications, automation prevents missed deadlines and ensures continuous compliance.
